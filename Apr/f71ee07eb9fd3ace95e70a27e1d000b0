Petra Diamonds on Friday recovered a 209.9 ct D-colour Type II gem-quality diamond at its Cullinan diamond mine, in South Africa. This is the third Type II D-colour gem-quality diamond weighing more than 100 ct recovered since March and the fourth such diamond recovered in the current financial year. Petra on Friday said the latest recovery again demonstrates the prevalence of these types of diamonds in the Cullinan orebody. It noted that there was an improved incidence of large and high-value stones as the C-Cut Phase 1 block cave "progresses across the footprint". The diamond will be sold during the company's next sales cycle in South Africa, along with a 425 ct D-colour Type IIA diamond that was recovered at Cullinan on March 29.
