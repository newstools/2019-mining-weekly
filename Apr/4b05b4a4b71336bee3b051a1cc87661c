US iron-ore miner Cleveland-Cliffs on Monday announced that it intends to offer to sell, subject to market and other conditions, a $750-million aggregate principal amount of senior notes, due in 2027, in an offering that is exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933. According to the NYSE-listed company, the notes will be guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the company’s material direct and indirect wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries. Net proceeds from the offering of the notes will be used to redeem all of Cliffs’ outstanding 4.875% senior notes, due in 2021, to fund the $600-million tender offer for its 5.75% senior guaranteed notes, due in 2025, including fees and expenses related to the tender offer and for other general corporate purposes.
