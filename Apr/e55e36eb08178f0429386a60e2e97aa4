TSX-listed Katanga Mining, a unit of Glencore, on Thursday announced that Glencore International’s Jeff Gerard would succeed Danny Callow as CEO of the company, effective May 2. Gerard’s appointment follows the signing of a management services agreement between Katanga and Glencore in January. The agreement is said to “better reflect the integrated nature of Katanga’s and Glencore International’s businesses and enhance existing controls”. Gerard, who has over 40 years of experience in the mineral resources sector, will also assume Callow’s seat on Katanga’s board of directors. Gerard joins Katanga from Glencore Coal, where he has been chief development officer, based in Sydney, since Glencore’s 2013 merger with Xstrata. Prior thereto, Gerard served as Xstrata Coal’s COO for Americas from 2006 to 2007 and COO for South Africa from 2007 to 2010. In addition to serving as the CEO of the company, Gerard will serve as the head of Glencore’s assets in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and oversee the Glencore group’s other operation in the DRC.
