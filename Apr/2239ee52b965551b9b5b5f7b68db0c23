Diamond major Alrosa earned $8.91-million in revenue from the sale of special size diamonds – diamonds larger than 10.8 ct – at its second auction in Dubai, this year. Fifty-six companies from Belgium, India, Israel, the United Arab Emirates, the US, Hong Kong and Russia participated in the auction, which resulted in the sale of 109 out of 122 auction lots on offer sold.
 
Two especially large diamonds, weighing 51.13 ct and 47.59 ct, were sold. "Beyond all doubt, this [Dubai] trading platform is successful. This time, the total weight of sold diamonds was more than 1 840 ct. "Until the end of the year, we are going to hold three more auctions here, expecting the same consistently high results," says Alrosa United Selling Organization executive committee member Evgeny Agureev.
