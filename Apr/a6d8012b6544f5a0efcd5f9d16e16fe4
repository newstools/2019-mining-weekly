TSX-listed Roxgold has completed a previously announced portfolio acquisition worth $20-million from Newcrest West Africa, which comprises 11 exploration permits in Côte d'Ivoire. The transaction includes the Séguéla project, which CEO and president John Dorward says has significant growth potential in the near-term through the near-surface Antenna deposit and attractive satellite opportunities, as well as a highly prospective large land package. The company will start with a 28 000 m drilling programme next week and a preliminary economic assessment study at Séguéla and nearby prospects.
