PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Coal miner Paringa Resources has shipped its first 1 500 t of washed coal from its Poplar Grove operation, in Western Kentucky. The maiden shipment was loaded into barges on the Green river, bound for cornerstone customer Louisville Gas and Electric Company and Kentucky Utilities Company. “Commencing sales from the Poplar Grove operation is a key milestone for the company in becoming a significant coal producer in Western Kentucky,” said Paringa MD Egan Antill. “The company remains focused on the successful ramp-up of operations towards nameplate capacity throughout 2019. We are very pleased to be working with local businesses and contributing significant direct and indirect employment opportunities in the region.” The 2.8-million-tonne-a-year Poplar Grove thermal coal mine forms part of Paringa’s 40 000-acre Buck Creek complex, which also contains the 3.8-million-tonne-a-year Cypress mine, where construction is set to begin in 2019.
