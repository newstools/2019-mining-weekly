PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Mining major Rio Tinto has recovered a 28.84 ct gem quality white diamond from its Argyle diamond mine, in Western Australia, marking one of the largest gem quality white diamonds in its 35-year history. Named Argyle Octavia™ in recognition of its octahedral shape, this rough diamond will be sold by tender in Antwerp later this year. “We are delighted with this discovery which is a testament to the extraordinary Argyle orebody that continues to deliver these miracles of nature, even as it nears the end of mine life,” CEO of Rio’s copper and diamond portfolio, Arnaud Soirat, said. The Argyle mine is the world's largest coloured diamond producer. Since production at the mine started in 1983, gem quality white diamonds greater than 20 ct have comprised around 0.00007% of Argyle's production.
