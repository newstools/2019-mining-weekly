NYSE- and TSX-listed Newmont Goldcorp on Monday said it would temporarily suspend operations at the Pe√±asquito mine, in Mexico, pending resolution of an illegal blockade by a trucking contractor and some members of the Cedros community that began on March 27. The company continued dialogue with blockade leaders and the Mexican authorities to resolve the matter. Newmont stated that a comprehensive contingency plan was in place to enable the safe and orderly resumption of operations once the illegal blockade was lifted. The mine produced 272 000 oz of gold in 2018.
