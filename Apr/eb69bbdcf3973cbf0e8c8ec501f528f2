A delegation of Cabinet Ministers, led by Mineral Resources Minister Gwede Mantashe, which were to meet with the Xolobeni community, in the Eastern Cape, on Thursday, has postponed its visit to the area owing to the heavy rainfall that has led to flooding and damaged roads in the province. The visit would have formed part of governmentâ€™s ongoing engagement with the community about an integrated and sustainable development approach for the area. The development model would look at, among others, road and transport infrastructure, agriculture and fisheries, tourism and mining. The inadequate road infrastructure, according to a statement issued by government on Wednesday, highlights the importance of government engaging with the Xolobeni community on the need for development in the area. It is within this context that Mantashe has insisted that it is false to limit the debate on the need for development in Xolobeni to mining only. A decision about whether mining occurs or not is yet to be taken and should happen within the context of the significance of the development of this area for the country, the statement said.
