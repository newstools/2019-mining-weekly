A decision by the Côte d'Ivoire government regarding the granting of an exploitation permit (EP) for ASX- and TSX-listed Perseus Mining’s Yaouré gold mine has been delayed, but is expected to be granted in the near future. The Côte d'Ivoire government was expected to consider the grant of the EP at a Cabinet meeting on April 10, but as a result of more urgent government business, there was insufficient time for the application to be tabled for approval at the meeting, the company said on Thursday. Perseus indicated that it expected the EP to be granted soon, given that Cabinet met each Wednesday to consider government business. It also noted its understanding that its subsidiary, Perseus Yaouré, had satisfied all requirements to enable the EP to be granted.
