PERTH (miningweekly.com) â€“ ASX-listed gold miner Evolution Mining has reported a fall in gold production for the three months to March, with the company remaining on track to reach its full year production guidance. Gold production in the March quarter was reported at 175 901 oz, down from the 181 996 oz delivered in the previous quarter, while silver production was down from 193 630 oz to 141 621 oz. Copper production for the quarter also declined slightly from 5 582 t to 4 750 t. Evolution on Wednesday reported that its Cowal mine, in New South Wales produced 64 117 oz of gold, compared with the 58 244 oz delivered in the previous quarter, while production at the Mungari mine, in Western Australia, decreased from 29 992 oz of gold to 24 966 oz. In Queensland, the Mt Carlton mine production remained relatively flat at 26 116 oz, while Mt Rawdon production also remained stable at 20 124 oz. Gold production at Cracow decreased from the 22 400 oz reported in the December quarter, to 18 158 oz, while production at Ernest Henry declined from 24 812 oz to 22 419 oz. Evolution in the quarter under review delivered an operating mine cash flow of A$168.3-million, compared with the A$191-million in the last quarter, and a net mine cash flow of A$107.8-million, compared with the A$108.5-million in the previous three months. The miner said that the lower operating cash flow was driven by the timing of both gold and copper sales, and was partially offset by higher realised metal prices. For the June quarter, Evolution is expecting gold production to be in the range of between 190 000 oz and 195 000 oz.
