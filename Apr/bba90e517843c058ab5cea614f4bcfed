Zanzibar Gold on Friday said it would acquire the Mkuvia gold property, in the Nachengwea area of southern Tanzania, as well as the Fakawi gold property, in the Handeni area of north-central Tanzania. The potential for low-cost extraction of placer gold from part of an extensive gold-bearing placer alluvium at Mkuvia will be investigated by Zanzibar. The Fakawi property, meanwhile, is an advanced hard rock exploration project that has widespread high-grade gold veins with several multigram assay results over 1 m of surface trenching, north of the one-million-ounce Magambezi deposit. No follow-up exploration has been conducted on these veins.
