PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Mineral Commodities (MRC) has struck a $9.2-million share purchase agreement with Skaland Graphite AS to acquire the Trælen graphite mine and the Skaland processing plant, in Norway. MRC would pay an initial cash consideration of $4.8-million and a further $4.4-million over a five year period, with the acquisition to be funded from existing cash reserves. “Skaland presents an excellent opportunity for MRC to gain near-term graphite production capacity,” said executive chairperson Mark Caruso. “When combined with the upcoming development of the Munglinup graphite project, MRC will, in a very short time, become a major global strategic graphite producer with two high-grade graphite producing assets in tier 1 jurisdications.” Skaland owns Norway’s only graphite operation in the Trælen mine, and produces some 10 000 t/y of graphite, accounting for around 2% of the global annual natural flake graphite production. The company is the largest flake graphite producer in Europe and the fourth-largest globally outside of China, and is the world’s highest-grade operating flake graphite mine. The acquisition of Skaland is subject to a number of conditions, including regulatory approvals to increase production to a minimum of 14 000 t/y, and the assignment or transfer of material permits and contracts. The acquisition is not subject to shareholder approval.
