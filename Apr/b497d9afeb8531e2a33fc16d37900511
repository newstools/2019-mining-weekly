JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) â€“ Sibanye-Stillwater on Tuesday afternoon confirmed that mineworkers at the Thembelani shaft have been held back from being hoisted back to surface for their own safety, after rails fell off a conveyance earlier in the day. The Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU) had earlier said that about 4 000 workers had been trapped at the mine. Sibanye spokesperson James Wellsted, however, told Mining Weekly Online that the workers were not trapped, but that the company was keeping the mineworkers at the station where they wait to be hoisted back to the surface, while an inspection of the shaft is undertaken. He confirmed that none of the workers were injured and that the area was fully ventilated. Workers would receive water, food and other supplies as necessary. The inspection of the shaft infrastructure is necessary to ensure that the shaft is cleared of rails and that there is no damage to the metal work. Moreover, there is a second exit available through the neighbouring Khuseleka shaft should it become necessary. Wellsted indicated that the inspection could take up to about three hours, as it is a big operation. Once assessed, workers would either be hoisted back up if deemed safe or transported through the neighbouring shaft.
