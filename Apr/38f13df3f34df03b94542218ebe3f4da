Independent mineral exploration and development company Alufer Mining has started detailed engineering studies for the proposed expansion of production at its Bel Air bauxite mine, in Guinea, to ten-million tonnes a year. The company on Wednesday said operations were on track to produce the yearly run rate of 5.5-million tonnes this year. Preliminary engineering studies to evaluate the expansion to a ten-million-tonne-a-year operation have shown robust economics, it noted. â€œWith the operational set up we have achieved to date, we are now looking to the next phase and analysing how we can create further value from the Bel Air project," Alufer CEO Bernie Pryor said in a statement.
