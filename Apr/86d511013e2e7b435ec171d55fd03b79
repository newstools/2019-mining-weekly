Aim-listed Armadale Capital has recorded progress in respect of the definitive feasibility study (DFS) for its Mahenge Liandu graphite project, in Tanzania. The company has received the final environmental- and social-impact assessment (Esia) report from external consultants, which concludes that the potential impacts associated with the proposed graphite mine and processing site are of a nature and extent that can be reduced, limited and eliminated by the application of appropriate mitigation measures. A decommissioning implementation plan has also been completed and considers options on how to use the site after mining is completed. Further, Armadale has received the relocation action plan (RAP), principally to engage with the local community and is on schedule to submit the final Esia report and the RAP to the National Environment Management Council of Tanzania by the end of April. “We are very pleased with the speed at which the DFS is advancing as we look to advance the world-class Mahenge Liandu graphite project in south-east Tanzania and establish a significant high-grade graphite mine,” commented Armadale director Nick Johansen in a statement on Friday. “Both the Esia report and the RAP are integral to this process, enabling us to apply for a mining licence, so we are delighted with the findings that appear favourable,” he added.
