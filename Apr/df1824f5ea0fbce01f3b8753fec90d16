London-listed precious metals miner Polymetal's Amursk pressure oxidation (POX) plant, has become the second gold production operation in Russia to be certified as being in full compliance with the International Cyanide Management Code (Cyanide Code) as both a gold mining company and, separately, as a cyanide transporter by the International Cyanide Management Institute. Polymetal became a signatory to the Cyanide Code as a mining company in 2016 and as a cyanide transporter in 2018, and an independent third-party auditor has recently completed an audit of the Amursk POX operation and supply chain, which confirmed that the operation maintains full compliance with the code's principles and practices. In addition, Polymetal has developed a corporate cyanide management system, which will be implemented this year and has fully integrated the Cyanide Code principles and standards of practice into its health, safety and environmental management systems.
