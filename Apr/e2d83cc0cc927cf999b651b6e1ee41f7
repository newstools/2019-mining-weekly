Aim- and TSX-V-listed Altus Strategies has defined a further significant prospect at its Diba gold project, in Mali. "Our detailed review of Diba's historical data, as reported on February 4, identified multiple priority drill targets including a 1.85-km-long anomalous zone adjacent to the historic Diba resource (Diba North West). In addition, a number of gaps were identified in the coverage of the surface geochemistry. “Our systematic programme of sampling in some of these areas has discovered a significant new prospect at Diba North West, with a footprint of about 650 m by 400 m. The results also highlight the potential for further discoveries to be made at Diba. “In addition, a 1.2-km-long potentially silicified ridge, located approximately 500 m southwest of and directly along strike of the historical resource will also be followed up,” notes CE Steven Poulton. Historical drilling at Diba has intercepted 5.02 g/t gold over 20 m and 5.36 g/t gold over 13 m from this prospect. Diba’s near-surface gold resource currently stands at 6.3-million tonnes, at 1.35 g/t gold for 275 000 oz, in the indicated category, while its inferred category resource stands at 720 000 t, at 1.40 g/t gold for 32 500 oz.
