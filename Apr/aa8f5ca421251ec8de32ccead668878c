PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Bardoc Gold has completed a A$12-million capital raise through a rights issue and share placement, well above the targeted A$11.3-million. The company placed some 175-million shares, at a price of 4c each, to raise an initial A$7-million, and undertook a one-for-ten non-renounceable pro-rata entitlement offer to raise the remaining funds. “We are delighted with the response to the entitlement issue and the previous A$7-million placement, which allows us to fast-track our Australian gold strategy and puts us in an outstanding position as an emerging Western Australian gold explorer and developer,” said Bardoc CEO Robert Ryan. “We have already commenced a 10 000 m reverse circulation and diamond drilling programme aimed at discovering new deposits which will add to the 2.6-million-ounce resource inventory at the Bardoc gold project,” Ryan said.
