London-listed Anglo Asian produces gold at Gedabek and other Azeri mines in a joint venture with the Azeri state in which the company holds 51%. The company said its total production of gold-equivalent ounces (GEO), which includes other metals, rose 11% in the first three months of this year to 20 287 GEO from 18 307 GEO.

It eventually plans to develop seven mines in western Azerbaijan, including Gedabek, with estimated gold reserves of 430 t in total. "I am very pleased to report that over 20 metric tonnes of gold equivalent have now been produced since the company started operations at Gedabek in 2009," Anglo Asian CEO Reza Vaziri said in a statement.
