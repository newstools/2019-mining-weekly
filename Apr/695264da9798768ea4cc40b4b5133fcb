Mineral Resources Minister Gwede Mantashe and Labour Minister Mildred Oliphant have welcomed the end of the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union’s (AMCU’s) five-month strike at Sibanye-Stillwater’s gold operations. The parties announced the resolution of their differences on Wednesday. Mantashe on Thursday said the development augured well for much-needed stability in the gold sector, and said the return to full production at Sibanye’s gold operations would positively impact on productivity figures in the gold sector. The conclusion of the strike is expected to result in peace, safety and security in and around the Carletonville community, the Minister said, adding that industry “must never tire to create a conducive environment for meaningful collective bargaining negotiations, coupled with working and living conditions free from the fear of violence and intimidation”. The Minister further noted that all social partners and stakeholders must do everything in their power to ensure a working, productive industry; and grow the economy. Oliphant, in a separate statement, congratulated the parties on reaching an amicable resolution and commended AMCU and Sibanye’s leadership on leading the process “to a happy conclusion, albeit after an exceedingly long period of time”. "This is victory for all involved – the sector, the economy and the country as a whole.  This, once again, is testimony that through social dialogue . . . nothing is impossible,” Oliphant stated.
