The Minerals Council South Africa has launched the third module of its Mining for Schools initiative – an online platform with resources for teachers and learners to reinforce, enhance and extend learning about the South African mining industry. Focusing on coal, the module sheds light on one of the country’s most abundant and valuable resources, the council highlighted in a statement on Tuesday. Coal is considered instrumental in South Africa’s development – not only for the mining sector, but also for the broader industrialisation of the country. The council acclaimed that the coal mining sector benefits the country’s economy and people in many ways. For example, in 2018, the local coal mining industry produced 252.5-million tonnes, contributed R139.4-billion in sales, employed 86 919 people who earned R24.7-billion in wages, paid R1.6-billion in royalties and spent R56-billion on goods and services. The coal module includes a booklet, downloadable posters and video. The council has developed the Mining for School website in alignment with the Grade 12 Economic Geography of South Africa: Mining section of the Department of Basic Education’s Curriculum and Assessment Policy Statement.
