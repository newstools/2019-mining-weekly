PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The Queensland Resources Council (QRC) has urged the state government to move forward the more than A$60-billion pipeline of resource projects that are currently in planning. The plea came in response to a government-funded newspaper advert spouting that since 2015, the state government has helped to deliver A$20-billion in resources projects, creating 7 000 jobs. “It’s great to celebrate the investment secured over the last four years, but no one won a race running backwards. We are in a race, commodity prices and demand is strong,” said QRC CEO Ian Macfarlane. “We are competing with the world for investment in the development of our resources - coal, gas and metals. Our resources are first class. We have dedicated and skilled workers. We need the confidence that stable policy settings from government gives to secure the new projects and new jobs for Queensland,” he said. Macfarlane noted that abrupt and unpredictable government policy and decision-making from government was the biggest threat to resource investment. “With Queensland’s unemployment rate now back over 6%, there is no better time to give the resources sector the renewed confidence to invest, employ and export for all Queenslanders.”
