JSE-listed Harmony Gold has been selected for the 2019 Bloomberg Gender Equality Index that distinguishes companies that are committed to transparency in gender reporting and advancing women’s equality. Harmony is one of 230 companies selected. The index has doubled in size compared with 2018 and includes firms from ten sectors headquartered across 36 countries and regions. The 230 companies have a combined market capitalisation of $9-trillion and employ more than 15-million people, of which seven-million are women. In this year’s index, 13 new markets are being represented for the first time, including Argentina, China, Israel and South Africa. Bloomberg’s standardised reporting framework for the index offers public companies the opportunity to disclose information on how they promote gender equality across four separate areas, namely company statistics, policies, community engagement and products and services. Reporting companies that score above a globally established threshold are included in the index. Bloomberg chairperson Peter Grauer stated on Thursday that, sadly, only 10% of eligible companies globally are disclosing their workplace gender policies and practices.
