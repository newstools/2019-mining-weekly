PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Energy giant BP has approved a $1.3-billion expansion of its Atlantis field, in the Gulf of Mexico. The Atlantis Phase 3 development will include the construction of a new subsea production system from eight new wells that will be tied into the current platform, off the US coast. The expansion project is scheduled to come on line in 2020, and will boost production at the existing platform by an estimated 38 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. “Atlantis Phase 3 shows how our latest technologies and digital techniques create real value – identifying opportunities, driving efficiencies and enabling the delivery of major projects. Developments like this are building an exciting future for our business in the Gulf,” said Starlee Sykes, BP’s regional president for the Gulf of Mexico and Canada. Mining major BHP, which holds the remaining 44% interest in the Atlantis project, is expected to make a final investment decision on the expansion early in 2019.
