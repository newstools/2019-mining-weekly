The processing plant front-end crushing circuit at Alphamin Resources' Bisie tin mine, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, has been successfully commissioned, on schedule. This includes the primary crusher, two tertiary crushers and the screening buildings. Ore is now being fed through this circuit to create a stockpile with which the gravity circuit can be commissioned.
 
The process plant in its entirety is planned to be commissioned, on track with the original schedule by the end of March.
 
Alphamin on Thursday also reported that the underground mine capital footprint had been completed at the end of December, two months ahead of schedule. The run-of-mine ore production rate was being ramped up to about 1 000 t/d to achieve the targeted steady-state feed rate to the processing plant.
 
"It is envisaged that the processing plant should ramp up to its nameplate production capacity of tin concentrates from April to the end of June 2019," the company said.
 
“To have achieved such significant progress, to date, on time and within budget for a project of this scale, in a challenging environment, is a testament to the skill and dedication of our staff and contractors on the ground. We look forward to the commencement of tin concentrate production in the near future and will keep the market appraised of developments in this regard,” said Alphamin CEO Boris Kamstra.
