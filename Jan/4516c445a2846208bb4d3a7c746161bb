PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Matt Gauci will step down as the MD of ASX-listed Metalicity, effective January 10. Nonexecutive director Mathew Longworth will assume the role of CEO, and the Metalicity board is currently in discussions with suitable executives to work alongside him as part of a transition to grow the company through exploration and project acquisition. Gauci, who is the founding MD of Metalicity, informed the board of his desire to focus on other opportunities, and following the sale of the Admiral Bay asset to Kimberley Mining, as well as the acquisition and options of new copper and nickel exploration projects, has seen this as the logical time to step aside. “Now is the right time to renew the leadership team to drive the next stage of Metalicity’s development to create shareholder value. The company is in a strong cash/equity position for a junior mining company, with 100% owned copper exploration projects in the Paterson Province and a controlling interest in zinc development company Kimberley Mining,” Gauci said. Longworth is an experienced geologist and mining executive, and has held COO, MD and CEO roles with Heron Resources. Prior to his appointment at Metalicity, he was exploration manager for Aurion Gold and Gold Fields.
