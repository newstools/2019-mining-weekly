TSX-listed Excellon Resources has appointed Marcello Locatelli as VP of special projects. He will be responsible for further optimisation at the company’s operations and project evaluation. “An essential part of our strategy is building a team that can discover, develop and operate mining assets so that we can fully realise on the next bull market in metals,” Excellon president and CEO Brendan Cahill commented on Tuesday, adding that “just as great mining assets have been increasingly rare in recent years, the demographic gap in mining portends the same for the industry’s most important asset – people”. He believes Locatelli’s global experience in optimising and evaluating projects will play an important role in improving the company’s existing operations and growing the business for the long term. Excellon owns the La Platosa silver mine, in Mexico. It also owns an exploration property in the country.
