Canada’s Environment and Climate Change Minister Catherine McKenna has announced an environmental decision for the underground gold and silver mine that IDM Mining is proposing near Stewart, British Columbia. The Minister said that the proposed mine was not likely to have significant adverse environmental effects if the 120 stipulated conditions were met. These conditions include measures to protect fish and fish habitat, migration of birds, species at risk, human health, physical and cultural heritage, as well as the current use of lands and resources by traditional Indigenous peoples. “We are confident that with the mitigation measures in place and the legally-binding conditions the proponent must fulfill, this project will move forward in a way that supports sustainable development,” McKenna said in a statement. The Red Mountain project had already gained provincial environmental approval. The mine, located in the Stewart district of the Nass Wildlife Area, is expected to extract 1 000 t a day of ore, with a net production of 365 000 t/y, during the mine’s six-year operational life.
