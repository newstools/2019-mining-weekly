PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Gold miner Resolute Mining has reported a near 20 000 oz increase in gold production during the December quarter, compared with the previous quarter. The miner on Monday reported that gold production in the three months to December reached 73 691 oz, up 18 183 oz on the September quarter production, or 33%, as gold production from the Syama operation, in Mali, increased by more than 50%. Syama produced 56 207 oz of gold during the quarter under review, with 34 653 oz coming from the oxide operations, and 21 554 oz coming from the sulphide operations. The Ravenswood mine, in Australia, produced a consistent 17 484 oz during the December quarter. Resolute MD and CEO John Welborn told shareholders on Monday that the December quarter had been a turning point for the company. “Production from Syama and Ravenswood is now on track and the commencement of sublevel caving at our Syama underground mine will provide further improvements as we commission the world’s first fully automated underground mine.” Ore production from the Syama underground mine started in December, and mining rates are expected to gradually build up over the first half of 2019, and will reach nameplate capacity of 200 000 t/m, or 2.4-million tonnes a year, by the end of June.
