PERTH (miningweekly.com) â€“ Diamond miner Lucapa Diamond Company produced 3 089 ct of diamonds from its Mothae operation, in Lesotho, during the December quarter. The 1.1-million-tonne treatment plant was commissioned during the December quarter, delivering Lucapa its second operational mine. Lucapa said on Wednesday that the ramp-up at Mothae continued to progress well, with the plant on target to reach its nameplate capacity of 90 000 t/m by the first quarter of 2019. The targeted treatment rate of 150 t/h has been achieved for extended periods, and was surpassed in December. At its Lulo operation, in Angola, Lucapa produced 5 070 ct during the December quarter, down 1% on the previous corresponding period due to the processing of gravels from lower-grade areas. Annual production for the full 2018 was up 3% on 2017, however, to 19 196 ct. During the quarter under review, the Lulo operation produced 50 special diamonds, bringing the full-year total to 214. The specials recovered during the quarter included three diamonds larger than 50 ct each, with the largest being 75 ct.
