PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Gold miner Perseus Mining has awarded ASX-listed Lycopodium the engineering and supply contract for its Yaouré gold project, in Côte d’Ivoire. Lycopodium told shareholders on Thursday that the contract is expected to generate some $95.1-million in revenue. The contract award was an extension of Lycopodium’s association with Perseus, following the delivery of the Sissingue gold project, and the completion of the definitive feasibility study and the front-end engineering and design for Yaouré. The contract award was subject to the finalization of formal documentation, as well as full project funding and the receipt of a mining permit. Yaouré is expected to cost $262.7-million to develop, and will produce 215 000 oz/y over its first five years of operations. The project would comprise two adjacent openpit operations, with ore also expected to be sourced from three pre-existing heap leach pads close to the run-of-mine pad. The ore would be transported to an adjacent processing plant, with tailings from the plant to be stored in a single facility to the south of the process plant. The plant would process at a nominal rate of 3.3-million tonnes a year.
