Aim-listed Edenville Energy has acquired a second excavator to increase the amount of mined material from its Rukwa coal-to-power project, in Tanzania. The company secured a $750 000 loan during the last few weeks of 2018, which has been used to fund the acquisition of the second excavator and four additional hired haul trucks. Further, Edenville has installed mobile in-pit lighting to allow 24-hour-a-day operation, further increasing the companyâ€™s mining capacity. The equipment has been deployed in a new mining area to the north of the current excavations. Operations in this northern area will start soon. Meanwhile, during December, the company completed works on the Lamella clarifier water treatment plant, which has been delivering the anticipated improvements to both water qualities in the plant process and in the return ponds, leading to higher coal processing plant productivity. The construction of a pre-screening plant and conveyors, designed to remove the majority of coal fines before they reach the washing circuit, is also complete and the plant is undergoing testing. Edenville expects the pre-screening plant to be fully integrated into the washed coal production process by the end of January.
