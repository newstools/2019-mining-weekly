Aim-listed Georgian Mining Corporation CEO Mike Struthers on Friday announced that the Georgian government had held a Cabinet meeting late in December to discuss the pending exploration permit for the company’s 50%-owned Bolnisi copper/gold project. The company had been expecting a resolution meeting to be scheduled since early October. “The resolution on the exploration permit was finally addressed at a government session. During the meeting, there were minor points for clarification raised with the mining agency, which were satisfactorily addressed and we are now awaiting final approval. “All of the ministries have responded positively and continued to be strong supporters of the application,” he said. The Bolnisi project is in a well-known geological region that has hosted many high-grade copper/gold deposits.
