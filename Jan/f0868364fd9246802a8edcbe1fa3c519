Matsa on Friday reported that mining at the Red Dog operation had generated 12 704 oz of gold, resulting in an operating profit of A$5.5-million. “I am delighted that mining at the Red Dog gold project produced a result that met expectations, producing an operating profit of A$5.5-million despite highly unusual and unexpected weather delays,” said Matsa executive chairperson Paul Poli. “By working closely with our contractors and continuing our good relationship with AngloGold Ashanti, our team at Matsa achieved this excellent outcome.” Matsa on Friday noted that the company has identified two more potential small-scale operations within the Lake Carey project area, which the company believed could be brought into production in 2019.
