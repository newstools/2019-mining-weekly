The Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU) has reiterated its plans to proceed with a secondary strike at Sibanye-Stillwater’s platinum operations from Tuesday. The strike will be in support of those AMCU members who have been on strike at the precious metals miner’s gold operations since November. AMCU members this week attended a Central Mass Meeting in Rustenburg, led by president Joseph Mathunjwa, general secretary Jimmy Gama and regional heads from various AMCU branches. “The secondary strike officially begins at Sibanye-Stillwater Platinum in support of the ongoing strike at the company’s gold operations,” said Mathunjwa. He added that AMCU members would go out in their numbers and march to the Minerals Council South Africa’s offices on Tuesday.
