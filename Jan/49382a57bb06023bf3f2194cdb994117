The Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU) on Monday confirmed it would embark on secondary strike action at Sibanye-Stillwater’s platinum operations in South Africa from January 22. This is in support of the strike at Sibanye’s gold operations on the West Rand and in the Free State, which has been ongoing since November 22. AMCU stated that it would continue its strike at the gold operations until its demands for a R1 000 increment for the next three-year period are met. The secondary strike will involve 12 500 ACMU members employed at the miner’s platinum operations, while the strike at the gold operations involves 15 000 members. “[The strike] will mark one of the biggest examples of mass rolling strike action across different mineral commodities by a single union in South African history,” stated AMCU president Joseph Mathunjwa. AMCU’s strike at the gold operations is ongoing despite Sibanye extending its wage offer, which it agreed with other trade unions, to all employees. In addition to its South African platinum and gold operations, the company also owns platinum group metals operations in the US.
