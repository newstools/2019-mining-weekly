PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Pantoro has reported a 33% increase in gold production during the December quarter, up from the previous quarter. The miner on Monday reported that gold production in December reached 12 657 oz, up from the 9 524 oz produced in the September quarter, as mining operations returned to expected production levels. Annualised production rates during the December quarter exceeded 50 000 oz, the miner told shareholders, with production predominantly sourced from the Nicolsons underground mine, while the Wagtail operation also continued. Production from the Halls’ Creek operation is expected to increase as production from the Wagtail mine is ramped up. Meanwhile, adits development at Wagtail South have identified additional high-grade ore, which will support a cutback of the current openpit in advance of establishing a second underground access for the Wagtail underground operation. Pantoro has applied for the approvals required to undertake the cutback and expects to start mining during the first half of this year, pending final approvals.
