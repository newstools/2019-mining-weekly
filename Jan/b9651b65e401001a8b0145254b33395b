TSX- and NYSE-listed Tahoe Resources’ shareholders have approved the proposed buyout of the company by Pan American Silver. Pan American’s shareholders, in turn, have approved resolutions related to the transaction, including the issue of common shares to Tahoe shareholders. Pan American has offered Tahoe shareholders $3.40, or 0.24 Pan American shares, for each Tahoe share held. Tahoe, which owns the troubled Escobal silver mine, in Guatemala, and gold mines in Peru and Canada, is scheduled to seek a final order approving the transaction from the Supreme Court of British Columbia on Wednesday. The arrangement is anticipated to be completed on or about February 26.
