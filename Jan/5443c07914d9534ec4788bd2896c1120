Vancouver-headquartered Goldcorp, which on Monday announced a $10-billion merger with gold major Newmont, produced 630 000 oz of gold in the fourth quarter of 2018, a 25% increase from the third quarter of 2018, and exceeding its previously stated guidance. Production for the year ended 2018 was 2.29-million ounces, compared with a guidance of 2.28-million ounces. All-in sustaining costs for the full year are expected to be at the revised guidance of $850/oz, the company said, noting that its complete 2018 financial results would be released on February 13. Meanwhile, the pyrite leach project at Peñasquito, Mexico, achieved commercial production during December. The project was completed under budget and ahead of schedule and was one of the first major projects completed using Goldcorp's investment framework. Further, Goldcorp  cancelled its investor day, originally scheduled for January 18, owing to the merger with Newmont.
