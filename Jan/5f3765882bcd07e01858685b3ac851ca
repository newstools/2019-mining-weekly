Diamond processing technology specialist DebTech is supplying its X-ray diamond recovery technology to Newfield Resources’ Tongo diamond mining project, in Sierra Leone. DebTech is collaborating with project house Paradigm Project Management on the project. DebTech’s mature sorting technology is a dependable solution for the highly efficient recovery of diamonds from a variety of kimberlite, marine and alluvial sources, and is capable of treating a material size range from 1 mm to 32 mm. Newfield specified the dry unit – CDX118CD – for the Tongo project. The unit features an eight-channel photo multiplier detection system that can identify all types of diamonds, including low luminescence, yellow and boart. DebTech product manager Gavin Alexander explained that the appeal of the technology was its efficient diamond recovery with minimum gangue material, even at high feed rates. “These rates can range from 825 kg/h with material sized between 1 mm and 2 mm, to 4.5 t/h with material sized between 16 mm and 32 mm.” Additionally, the unit has a “dual-wavelength” detection system and a small installed footprint, while being capable of self-testing. The unit can be calibrated while being on line. “There are manual and automated inlet chute gate options available, with a robust air ejector system that ensures no loss of valuable stones. Design is modular, compact and ergonomic, with left and right-hand variants available. The split cabinet design features a heat exchanger-cooled X-ray generator and power supply compartment with separate control and service panel configurations,” Alexander noted. DebTech’s equipment is backed by full maintenance support all over the world.
