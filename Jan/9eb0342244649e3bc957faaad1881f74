The President last year announced a five-year $100-billion investment plan. The mining sector is one of the driving forces behind the country’s economic development and will impact on the President’s future plans. Another Head of State Ghanaian President Nana Akufo-Addo has also been confirmed as a speaker at this year’s Indaba.
