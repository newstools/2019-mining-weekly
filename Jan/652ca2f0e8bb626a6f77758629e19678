PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The first concentrate shipment from the recommissioned Savannah nickel/copper/cobalt project, in Western Australia, is expected in early February, ASX-listed Panoramic Resources said on Tuesday. The company told shareholders that mining ramp-up to full production was continuing, with the Savannah process plant achieving a throughput rate of more than 2 000 t/d in early January. Trucking of the concentrate has also started to port. “Activities at site have gathered momentum in the past few months as the recruitment of personnel continued and mining and milling operations recommenced after a two-and-a-half year hiatus,” said Panoramic MD Peter Harold. “We still need to fill a number of positions, particularly in mining and maintenance, and that, together with some unscheduled events, slowed the ramp-up of mining, however, we have identified the issues and have plans in place to resolve those. “The mill has ramped up to nameplate capacity and we have booked our first concentrate ship, which is due to arrive for loading in early February,” said Harold. Savannah was placed on care and maintenance in May 2016, as nickel prices plummeted. A 2017 feasibility study on restarting the project found that it would require a capital investment of A$36-million and could produce 10 800 t/y of nickel, 6 100 t/y of copper and 800 t/y of cobalt.
