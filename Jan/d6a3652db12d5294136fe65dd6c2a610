PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Atrum Coal has reported a 170% increase in the Joint Ore Reserves Committee- (Jorc-) compliant resource estimate at its Elan South deposit, in Alberta, Canada. The Elan South deposit is now estimated to host some 97-million tonnes of resource, up from the previous estimate of 61-million tonnes, following the 2018 exploration programme that consisted of 37 boreholes. “We are very excited by this significant increase in the Jorc resource estimate for our Elan South deposit. This increase was driven by Atrum’s highly successful 2018 exploration programme. The combined 97-million tonnes of indicated and inferred resource has validated our belief that Elan South holds substantial hard coking coal resources,” said Atrum nonexecutive chairperson Charles Blixt. “Elan South represents just one targeted development area at Elan. Updated Jorc resource estimates for the other deposits within the Elan coking coal project are expected in late January,” he added.
