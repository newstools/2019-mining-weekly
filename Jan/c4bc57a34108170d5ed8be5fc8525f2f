Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU) president Joseph Mathunjwa on Wednesday said the union would continue its protected strike at Sibanye-Stillwater’s gold operations until its demands for a R1 000 increment for the next three-year period are met. He assured members and media at the first central mass meeting of this year that the strike would proceed despite the multiple attempts made by Sibanye to hinder it. He also stated that the protected strike would encompass several marches to key locations including a march to the JSE’s offices, in Sandton. The union’s president further went on to reveal some of the union’s other plans for the year ahead, including a secondary strike in the platinum sector in support of the strike against Sibanye, which also owns platinum mines in South Africa. “We want to show the Sibanye CEO and executives that we mean business when it comes to fighting for and protecting the rights of workers. We will stand up and make them listen by affecting them where it hurts the most,” added Mathunjwa. He explained that, this year, in a demonstration of the right to free association, AMCU would stage a national central mass meeting that would incorporate all AMCU regional offices. Mathunjwa alluded that the purpose of this meeting was to help establish a government that will ensure the protection of workers’ rights. “ . . . We want to demonstrate our commitment to a government that fights for the rights and dignity of workers in this country – therefore, we will decide on which political party is best mandated to do this and hold them accountable by means of our vote,” he explained.
