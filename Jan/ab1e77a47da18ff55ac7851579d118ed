PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Coal developer Pacific American Coal has reported an 18% increase in the Joint Ore Reserves Committee-compliant resource of its Elko coking coal project, in British Columbia. The project is now estimated to host some 303-million tonnes of coal, with 117-million tonnes of the resource classified within the measured category. The company said on Wednesday that the majority of the increase came from the identification of three new coal seams, ranging in thickness from 1.8 m to 3 m. “Pacific American Coal’s board is delighted that we have been able to deliver such a significant increase in our Elko resource,” said chairperson Geoff Hill. “This is a wonderful achievement for our team and shareholders. Most pleasing is the significant increase in tonnage in the high value top seams, including the newly identified Elk Formation coal seams, demonstrating excellent coal quality characteristics.” He noted that, based on these results, the project warranted further investment.
