An updated mineral resource estimate on the BAM gold deposit at London-listed Landore Resources’ Junior Lake Property, in Ontario, Canada, has significantly increased the deposit’s gold resource to 28.83-million tonnes at 1.03 g/t gold for 951 000 oz of gold, including 20.20-million tonnes at 1.08 g/t gold for 701 000 oz of gold in the indicated category. The estimate has also modelled potential mineralised material in target areas adjacent to the current delineated deposits for a possible 14.76-million tonnes at 0.93 g/t gold for a further 441 000 oz of gold, in the “unclassified” material category. The BAM east gold deposit is located about mid-way along a highly prospective Archean greenstone belt, which traverses the Junior Lake Property from east to west for about 31 km. The favourable greenstone belt is between 500 m and 1.5 km wide and hosts multiple known gold occurrences, including the Lamaune gold prospect. The mineral resource estimate, together with ongoing metallurgical and geotechnical studies, will be incorporated into a preliminary economic assessment scheduled for completion in February. “The 2018 drilling campaign on the BAM gold deposit has increased the mineral resource estimate by 53% to 951 000 oz of gold, while maintaining the outstanding strike rate of about 30 oz of gold per metre for the 31 594 m drilled on the deposit to date together with the excellent conversion rate of inferred to indicated and unclassified material into inferred ounces of gold,” Landore CEO Bill Humphries said in a release published on Tuesday. The continued rapid growth of the BAM gold deposit, the possible future development of the other known gold prospects such as Lamaune, and the likelihood of new discoveries along this highly prospective 31-km-long Archean greenstone belt are expected to bode well for the future of the Junior Lake Property.
