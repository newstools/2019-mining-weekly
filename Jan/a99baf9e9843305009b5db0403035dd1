PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Gold miner Dacian Gold has declared commercial production at its Mt Morgans gold project, in Western Australia, during the month of December. The company on Wednesday reported that the declaration was made at the start of January after mining rates across the operation achieved feasibility study design levels during the December quarter. “We are pleased to have achieved this important milestone exactly when we said we would,” said Dacian executive chairperson and CEO Rohan Williams. “It was an outstanding quarter, with production increasing 30% from the September quarter. Again, this ramp-up is in line with our stated objective of materially increasing quarterly production levels over the course of 2019.” Gold production during the December quarter reached 37 930 oz, and is expected to progressively increase through the remainder of the 2019 financial year.
