JSE- and NYSE-listed precious metals miner Sibanye-Stillwater has established a Global Safe Production Advisory Panel, after identifying the need for an additional safety initiative in 2018. The panel consists of a group of leading academics and is chaired by Sibanye group safety head Dr Kobus de Jager. The panel has a mandate to provide international insights, best practices and expertise in the continuous advancement of safe production mining practices. Five external members of the panel have been appointed. They are US-based Colorado School of Mines mining engineering department head Professor Priscilla Nelson, Australia-based University of Queensland Sustainable Mineral Institute director Professor Neville Plint, Germany-based Georg Agricola University of Applied Sciences president Professor Jürgen Kretschmann, University of the Witwatersrand engineering and built environment faculty dean Professor Ian Jandrell and Canada-based Laurentian University mining innovation president Vic Pakalnis. Meanwhile, Sibanye on Thursday reported that its South African operations have achieved a safe production milestone of five-million fatality-free shifts as at January 10. The milestone followed the company’s US platinum operations achieving five-million fatality-free shifts on January 4. “These safe production milestones represent a significant recovery in safety across the group, following a challenging first six months in 2018. These encouraging achievements are the outcome of an intensified focus on safe production, as part of the adoption of the Sibanye ‘Zero Harm’ framework, which was jointly developed with direct support of organised labour and the Department of Mineral Resources through a series of safety summits. “All stakeholders have contributed towards a goal of zero harm by building on our focus of creating an enabled environment, with empowered people who make values-based decisions and use fit-for-purpose systems,” the miner stated.
