NYSE-listed Mosaic Company has acquired the US Army Corps of Engineers 404 permit for its Ona phosphate mine project, in Hardee County, in Florida. The 404 permit was the final remaining permit for the project and secured 160.2-million tonnes of phosphate rock for future mining, the phosphate and potash producer said in a statement. Permitting efforts for the Ona project began in 2011, with mining permits from the State of Florida having been issued in 2015. Local government permits were secured in July 2018. The overall project covers 22 483 acres with 16 778 acres of land permitted for mining. The western extent of the project will extend the life of Mosaic’s Four Corners mine by 14 years, while the eastern extent will provide mining for future decades at the South Pasture mine, once production resumes at that facility. Mosaic president and CEO Joc O’Rourke says the project helps to secure the continued operation of the company’s Florida manufacturing facilities. The project would also deliver value to the local community, company employees and investors, he added.
