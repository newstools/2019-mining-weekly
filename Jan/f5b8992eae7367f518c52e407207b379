Aim-listed Central Asia Metals (CAM) met its 2018 production guidance for copper, zinc and lead at the Kounrad dump leach, solvent extraction and electrowinning copper recovery plant, in Kazakhstan, as well as at the Sasa zinc/lead mine, in Macedonia. Kounrad produced 14 049 t of copper in 2018, while Sasa delivered 22 532 t of zinc in concentrate and 29 388 t of lead in concentrate. “2018 has been transformational for us, as we have operated both of our assets for a full year, meeting our production targets for the three base metals – copper, zinc and lead,” CEO Nigel Robinson commented in a statement on Wednesday. CAM expects to produce 12 500 t to 13 500 t of copper, 22 000 t to 24 000 t of zinc in concentrate and 28 000 t to 30 000 t of lead in concentrate this year. Robinson further highlighted “encouraging” results from exploration drilling at Sasa, with the overall outcome of this work to be demonstrated in an updated Joint Ore Reserves Committee-compliant mineral resource estimate that will be completed during the current quarter. Meanwhile, construction of the tailings storage facility 4 (TSF4), at Sasa, is materially complete and is now expected to be concluded in the first half of this year. TSF4 should provide tailings storage for seven years. CAM has also started a life-of-mine study at Sasa. This work programme will entail an in-depth review of each aspect of the Sasa operation and is expected to be completed throughout the course of 2019.
