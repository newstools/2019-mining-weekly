TSX-listed Imperial Metals Corporation has suspended operations at its Mount Polley mine, in Canada’s British Columbia province, owing to declining copper prices. The suspension plan of the mine includes milling of low-grade stockpiles, which should extend the operations to the end of May. The company on Monday assured that there would be no impact to the mine’s ongoing environmental monitoring and remediation programme. Full operations will resume once the economics of mining at Mount Polley improve. Imperial, through its subsidiaries, owns the Red Chris, Mount Polley and Huckleberry copper mines in British Columbia, while holding a 50% stake in the Ruddock Creek lead/zinc prospect, also in British Columbia.
