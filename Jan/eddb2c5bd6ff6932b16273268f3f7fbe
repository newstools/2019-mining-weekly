PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Coal miner Whitehaven Coal has reported record quarterly run-of-mine production of 7.4-million tonnes, and first half production of 11-million tonnes. The miner on Thursday told shareholders that it was on track to meet its full year production guidance of between 22-million and 23-million tonnes of saleable coal. “Record quarterly run-of-mine production, including strong quarterly production at both Narrabri and Maules Creek, sees us firmly on track to meet full year production guidance,” said CEO and MD Paul Flynn. “Maules Creek and Narrabri have done a lot of the heavy lifting in the second quarter, but as with previous years, we expect all our opencuts to contribute to a strong full-year result.” Saleable coal production for the quarter was up 11% compared with the previous corresponding period, to 5.5-million ounces, while half-year saleable coal production was down 12%, to 9.5-million tonnes. Coal sales for the quarter were down 7%, to 5.4-million tonnes, while 10.2-million tonnes was sold in the half-year, down 14% on the previous corresponding period.
