Chinese group Zijin Mining has acquired a further 9.5-million shares, or 3.05%, of TSX- and NYSE American-listed Nevsun Resources for $57-million. Zijin last year offered to buy out all the issued and outstanding common shares of Nevsun for C$6 apiece. In addition to the newly acquired shares, and 276-million shares bought in December, Zijin now owns 92.44% of Nevsun. As the buyout offer has expired, Zijin intends to acquire the last remaining shares by way of compulsory acquisition, after which Nevsun will effectively delist from the TSX and the NYSE American. Nevsun owns the Bisha copper/zinc mine, in Eritrea, and the Timok copper/gold project, in Serbia.
