PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Titan Minerals has received environmental permitting for its Vista gold plant and mill, in Peru. The company told shareholders on Wednesday that with the environmental approval now in place, the plant was ready for physical inspection by the Direccion Regional De Energia Y Minas for an operator’s permit. The inspection would take a minimum of ten days to complete. Once the operator’s permit is received the plant will be fully permitted and licensed to start commercial production, with commissioning expected over the coming month. “We are very pleased to have received environmental approval from the provincial mines department so soon after finishing the construction of the plant,” said Titan executive chairperson Matt Carr. “Dry commissioning of the plant is well under way for equipment testing associated with pending inspections, and lower-grade stockpiles on hand for commencement of wet commissioning in the coming weeks, once the operating permit has been received.” When fully commissioned, the Vista plant will have a nameplate capacity of 150 t/d, more than tripling the operating capacity of the existing Tulin plant. At nameplate capacity, Vista is expected to generate up to 90 oz/d based on monthly average grades of 17.5 g/t to 24.4 g/t at the Tulin plant, over the past six months.
