PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Wollongong Coal on Thursday told shareholders that the protected industrial action at its Wongawalli Colliery, in New South Wales, had come to an end. On January 11, contract workers at the project went on strike relating to a proposed enterprise agreement between the labour hire contractor and its employees. Wollongong on Thursday welcomed what it called an ‘amicable resolution’ of the labour dispute, with COO Wayne Sly saying the company was not a party to the dispute, but had come forward in the spirit of concern for the miners and for the community at large. “We have offered to assist and support the labour hire contractor in meeting the contract miner’s demands to ensure the dispute comes to an early resolution and miners are not severely financially impacted as a result of a lengthy strike. “We made our decision based on what would be the best outcome to benefit miners and their families.”
