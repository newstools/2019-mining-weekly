The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) in the Highveld Region will lead a protest march on Wednesday, in Pretoria, to demand the immediate payment of salaries owed to hundreds of mineworkers at the Optimum and Koornfontein collieries, in Mpumalanga. Union members will further demand that the mines are brought back into operation and that the existing business rescue plan be brought to finality. More than 2 000 employees at the mines have not received their salaries for the past three months, the union said.
