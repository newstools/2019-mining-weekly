Rambler Metals and Mining has applied for a voluntary delisting of the company’s ordinary shares from the TSX-V. Its shares, which are currently listed for trading on the TSX-V and Aim, will continue to trade on Aim where the vast majority of trading activity takes place, the company said on Monday. Rambler’s directors stated that they believe the minimal trading activity of the company’s shares on the TSX-V no longer justifies the expense and administrative requirements associated with maintaining the dual listing. Additionally, the company believes its continuing Aim listing will provide its shareholders with a sufficiently liquid market. Subject to its application being accepted by the TSX-V, it is expected that the shares will be delisted from the TSX-V at the close of trading on January 15. Following delisting from the TSX-V, the company will also be closing its Canadian share register and merging it with the principal register in the UK to be maintained by Computershare Investor Services. The company’s Canadian share register will, however, remain open until April 15, in order to enable shareholders and Canadian Depository for Securities participants currently on the Canadian register to request to have their shares issued to a broker within the UK settlement system, Crest.
