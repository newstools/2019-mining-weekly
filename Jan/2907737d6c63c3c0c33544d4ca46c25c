Trade union Solidarity on Friday welcomed the sequestration of former Aurora Empowerment Systems director Khulubuse Zuma.
 
This followed after he failed to comply with the repayment agreement that the liquidators, with the support of Solidarity, agreed upon with Zuma.
 
Solidarity general secretary Gideon du Plessis said this means justice would finally prevail for the 5 300 Aurora employees who lost their jobs, after Aurora destroyed the Pamodzi mines that were temporarily placed under their supervision by the Pamodzi liquidators in 2009/10 and after Aurora also failed to pay the employees’ salaries for a period of eight months. Du Plessis further said the sequestration order also meant that a full investigation could now be conducted into all of Zuma’s business interests from September 2009, when he was appointed as a director of Aurora until the date of sequestration. “Hopefully this investigation will reveal what happened to the approximately R170-million that disappeared at the mines and also what Zuma’s business interests in Africa was or is,” said Du Plessis. The investigation would also determine whether Zuma has any interests in Dubai. Du Plessis said that, in the meantime, Zuma’s possessions would be auctioned off and hopefully the proceeds of the auction could be used to pay some of the former Aurora employees’ outstanding salaries. The sequestration application for another former Aurora director Zondwa Mandela will be heard in February. Sequestration applications against other former Aurora directors, Fazel and Solly Bhana, are also being finalised.
