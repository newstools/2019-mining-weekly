PERTH (miningweekly.com) â€“ Junior gold miner Westgold Resources told shareholders on Thursday that a production restart at its Meekatharra operation, in Western Australia, has been delayed. The miner earlier this week warned of an estimated 2 500 oz shortfall in quarterly productions from Meekatharra after routine maintenance uncovered issues with the white metal bearings on the semi-autogenous grinding (SAG) mill at the Bluebird processing plant. The processing plant was initially expected to come back online before the end of the week, however, Westgold on Thursday said that ore processing was yet to occur, as a completely new bearing was being manufactured, and would only be available for fitting late next week. The ASX-listed company said that while ore processing at Meekatharra has been impacted, mining activities remain unaffected, with ore stocks continuing to be built. Westgold has started trucking some of its higher-grade ore from Meekatharra to its Tuckabianna mill, at the Cue gold operation, to offset production losses. Furthermore, the Bluebird process circuit is also being amended to bypass the SAG mill and operate the ball mills in series. The plant is expected to restart processing at a reduced rate in the coming days, further mitigating production losses while the SAG mill repairs were being completed.
