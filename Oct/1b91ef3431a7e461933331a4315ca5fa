Mining services contractor Rosond has successfully achieved one full year with no lost time injuries (LTI) across all of its operations. During its 2019 financial year, which ended on September 30, about 1 100 employees completed their shifts and returned home safely, working a total of more than 2.2-million hours. In a statement on Monday, the company noted that this was the company’s first LTI-free year in its 63-year history – although some of Rosond’s sites have remained LTI-free for as long as ten years. Rosond has recently introduced new technologies to further secure the safety of its employees, by removing them from the immediate drill site. Rosond safety manager Andre Kleynhans expressed confidence at the end of 2018 that the company was capable of “achieving a zero harm year. ” He had listed the company’s steps towards achieving this goal as focusing on safe behaviour; emphasising establishing good safety habits and eliminating bad ones; increasing hands-on management; conducting quarterly safety drives; and engineering out hazards through innovation. Kleynhans attributed achieving the one-year LTI-free goal to strong leadership and shared responsibility. “Although we have now achieved one year LTI-free, we will continue to pursue ways and means of making our working environment even safer, while increasing productivity. “Our aim is to do this by addressing safety on an emotional level and through the further assistance of technology. We are also considering the merits of matching crews to be more compatible, using psychometric testing,” said Rosond MD Ricardo Cravo Ribeiro.
