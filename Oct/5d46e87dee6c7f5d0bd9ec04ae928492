PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Gold developer Focus Minerals has reported a maiden Joint Ore Reserves Committee-compliant resource for its Beasley Creek deposit, which forms part of the proposed production pipeline for the Stage 1 Laverton gold project, in Western Australia. Beasley Creek has now been estimated to host some 2.66-million tonnes, grading 2.24 g/t gold for 191 900 oz of gold, of which 35 400 oz is classified as inferred and the remainder indicated. The Beasley Creek deposit is one of several significant deposits and prospects across the Laverton gold project, which covers 507 km2. Focus CEO Zhaoya Wang said that the maiden resource and promising metallurgical testing results at Beasley Creek could potentially deliver a low start-up cost asset, which could lay a solid foundation to Focus’ Laverton production strategy as Stage 1 of the production pipeline starts to take shape. “Focus is continuing its exploration efforts across our Laverton gold project area as we work towards establishing a resource to underpin the Stage 1 life-of-mine production profile of at least five years.”
