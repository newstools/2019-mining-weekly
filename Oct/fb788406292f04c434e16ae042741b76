London-listed Rainbow Rare Earths says demand for its product remains strong, as the company shipped 100 t of concentrate grading 56% total rare earth oxides (TREO) in October. “The concentrate from the Gakara project, in Burundi, contains very low levels of both uranium and thorium, meaning it is readily shippable on the open seas,” the company said in a statement on Tuesday. Rainbow expects production levels to be lower while necessary works are performed to achieve higher production – the company is shifting focus from high-grade vein mining to a more broad, mechanised operation. To achieve the transformation to a mechanised operation, the company is undertaking detailed geological work to establish a drill area that will support this strategy. The company targets a ten-year life-of-mine, with Stage 1 production of 10 000 t/y of concentrate grading about 54% to 56% TREO. The company is also working to publish an updated resource statement, which will support the targeted production levels, early next year.
