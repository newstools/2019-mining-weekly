PERTH (miningweekly.com) â€“ Metals miner Kingsrose Mining on Monday announced that its Way Linggo gold/silver project, in Indonesia, has now been connected to the main power grid, which will result in a significant cost reduction for the miner. The power will be supplied at a government-gazetted rate, which is significantly cheaper to the diesel generators currently in operation at the site. Kingsrose told shareholders that while the mainline power will initially supply the processing plant and camp with power, the connection would be upgraded to meet the demands of any future underground operation. A detailed technical review recently extended the mine life of the openpit Talang Santo operation, at Way Linggo, with mining now expected to cease in July next year, while gold production from stockpiled ores would continue until September next year. Meanwhile, mining at the Way Linggo openpit mine is still scheduled to run until December this year, with gold production to continue until June 2020 from stockpiled ore.
