Aim-listed Edenville Energy has appointed Alistair Muir CEO, effective November 1. He succeeds Rufus Short, who is stepping down to devote more time to family and other interests, but will continue serving on the board as nonexecutive director. Muir has served on the company’s board as a nonexecutive director since September and has more than 25 years of operational experience within the mining industry, including the coal, uranium and iron-ore sectors. "I am pleased that we have someone of the calibre of Alistair to take on the role of CEO. He has a wealth of operational mining experience, including in Tanzania. “In particular, his international coal mining experience, coupled with project management expertise, make him ideally suited to his new role as we continue to progress our flagship Rukwa coal project in Tanzania,” said nonexecutive chairperson Jeffrey Malaihollo.
