Dual-listed Aura Energy has declared a new global resource of two-billion tonnes, at an average of 0.3% vanadium, containing 13.3-billion pounds of vanadium at the Häggån battery metals project, in Sweden. The resource estimate includes 320-million pounds of vanadium at 0.35% as indicated resource, and 13-billion pounds at 0.3% vanadium as inferred resource. Aura says the infill drilling and modelling work has confirmed 42-million tonnes at 0.35% vanadium and a 0.2% cut-off as indicated resource in a coherent near-surface zone. The resource estimate is based on 16 500 m of diamond drilling in 91 drillholes. Häggån is a large poly-metallic deposit containing economically significant levels of vanadium, nickel, zinc, molybdenum and other metals.
