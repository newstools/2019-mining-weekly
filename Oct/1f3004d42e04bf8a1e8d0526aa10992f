Triple-listed Caledonia Mining Corporation says electricity supply to its Blanket mine, in Zimbabwe, has improved since late August. The TSX-, NYSE- and LSE-listed company attributed the improved electricity supply to a new electricity pricing schedule introduced by government for the mining industry to support the funding of imported electricity, which is used exclusively to supply participating mining companies. Electricity is now priced in dollars at a cost slightly lower than the pricing structure prior to the recent monetary devaluation. The Zimbabwean electricity supply authorities have also implemented an uninterrupted power supply agreement for the mining industry in an effort to support the sector and electricity supply has stabilised following these changes. Nonetheless, Caledonia has bought an additional 6 MW diesel generator to complement its current 12.5 MW diesel generator capacity, to insulate the mine and Central Shaft project from the risk of unstable electricity supply. Additionally, the company stated that it was evaluating a project to install solar photovoltaic generating capacity at Blanket to further reduce dependence on the grid, reduce operational costs and ensure a more environmentally sustainable electricity supply. Caledonia will soon embark on a tender process for interested parties to build and operate the proposed solar project.
