Marking organisation Platinum Guild International (PGI) has opened the doors of its first showroom in Shenzhen – China’s jewellery manufacturing hub. The showroom is part of a comprehensive strategy to accelerate the manufacture and distribution of new-generation platinum jewellery designs targeting China’s younger consumers who are redefining tastes and trends in the world’s largest platinum jewellery market. “Research has shown that the number one barrier to acquiring platinum jewellery in recent years has been the lack of appealing designs, so PGI has worked closely with key industry manufacturers and retailers to fast-forward the adoption of new designs. “This showroom will showcase the abundance of new designs now available, together with innovative ways to merchandise and brand collections for today’s [discerning] consumers,” PGI CEO Huw Daniel said in a statement on Tuesday. PGI develops the platinum jewellery market globally by providing consumer intelligence, new product development, and sales and marketing services for its various industry partners. The establishment of the Platinum Jewellery Advisory Council in August, and the opening of the PGI showroom, mark an increasing level of collaboration with industry partners to accelerate the transformation of platinum jewellery in China’s fast-changing jewellery market. “The opening of a showroom in Shenzhen provides a stronger presence for platinum jewellery in the traditionally gold intensive jewellery manufacturing hub of China and will further showcase the platinum jewellery industry’s advanced craftsmanship and cutting-edge designs to expand the business potential of China,” commented PGI China MD Pui Poon. The PGI showroom includes premium display cabinets and windows that will be refreshed monthly to showcase industry partners’ new and distinctive platinum jewellery collections.
