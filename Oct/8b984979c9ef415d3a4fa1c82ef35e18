PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Federal Resources Minister Matt Canavan has welcomed the opening of Indian major Adani Mining’s new business centre in Rockhampton, which will support the recruitment and contracting for its Carmichael coal project. Adani on Friday also announced a A$100-million rail contract with railway developer Martinus Rail. “I spent years fighting for the Adani project because it means delivering jobs and economic activity for regional Queensland. Today’s announcements are more proof in the pudding. Around 150 people are already employed at the Carmichael site while more are employed at the company’s headquarters in Townsville. Now there will be more direct jobs and contractor jobs,” Canavan said. Federal Member for Capricornia, Michelle Landry said today’s developments are great news for Rockhampton and Central Queensland. The Rockhampton business centre will continue to provide ongoing opportunities during the current construction phase, and during Adani’s operations. “Earlier this year, Adani’s Carmichael project received final approvals, the start of a realisation of an enormous economic opportunity for the communities of Central Queensland. Today’s new business centre opening and rail contract announcement means more jobs and economic activity for Central Queensland,” Canavan concluded.
