PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Mali Lithium on Monday announced that a water licence has been received from the Malian government for the Goulamina lithium project, allowing the company to pump water from the nearby Selingue dam, de-risking the water supply. The water will be pumped 29 km from the dam to a surface water run-off facility, with the volume of water to be determined by what is produced from bores and harvested volumes. Furthermore, Mali Lithium is also looking at operational cost savings by using alternatives to diesel power generating, and looking at reduced road transport costs by using a combination of shorter route to port and backloading of product using empty trucks returning to port. “The project team has done a fantastic job in optimising the three key areas of water, power and transportation of product. Now during the completion of a definitive feasibility study in the next few months, this work can be crystallised into increased operational efficiency, reduced risk and reduced cost,” said Mali Lithium MD Chris Evans. An updated prefeasibility study into the Goulamina project had previously estimated that it could produce an average 362 000 t/y of spodumene concentrate, or a total of 5.7-million tonnes of concentrate over an initial mine life of 16 years, based on a two-million-tonne-a-year mineral concentrating plant. The project is estimated to have a net present value of A$653-million and an internal rate of return of 49.5%, and will require a capital investment of A$196-million.
