Canadian gold company Argonaut Gold said over the weekend that two people working for its mining contractor at the La Colorada mine, in Sonara, Mexico, had died. The individuals were fatality injured on Friday in a high-voltage accident while performing maintenance on a haul truck. Argonaut temporarily suspended operations following the incident, but said on Saturday that normal operations had resumed. A Department of Labour investigation is under way.
