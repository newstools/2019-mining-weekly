PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Heron Resources has generated its first revenue from zinc and lead concentrate sales from its Woodlawn project, in New South Wales. Ore processing at the Woodlawn project started in May this year, and at steady state, the project is expected to produce 70 000 t/y of zinc concentrates, 30 000 t/y of copper concentrates and 25 000 t/y of lead concentrates. Heron on Thursday said that the first 5 000 t of zinc concentrate has now departed from Port Kembla, bound for China, with the concentrate sold under an existing offtake agreement with IMX which extends from the start of production until the end of 2021. The offtake contract covers 100% of the zinc, copper and lead concentrates produced over this period. “The achievement of first cashflow from operations at Woodlawn is another key milestone for Heron. Although significantly later than planned due to delays in completion of construction and plant commissioning, this achievement confirms the marketability of the Woodlawn product,” said Heron chairperson Stephen Dennis. “With all export logistics arrangements now proven, the continuing focus of operations is on ramping up production, further improving product quality, and accelerating deliveries to our customers.”
