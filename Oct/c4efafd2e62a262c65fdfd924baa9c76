PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Kalium Lakes has awarded contracts for the construction of a A$20-million gas pipeline to supply gas to its recently approved Beyondie sulphate of potash (SoP) project, in Western Australia. The scope of the gas pipeline has been divided into three major contracts, including the manufacture and supply of the coated linepipe by Edgen Murray, the installation of the pipeline by Pipecraft, and the design, supply and construction of the inlet and delivery stations, as well as the pipeline by Primero. Kalium Lakes CEO Rudolph van Niekerk on Monday said that the company was pleased to have concluded the award of the contracts to reputable contractors and suppliers. “These contracts will not only supply gas for the initial 90 000 t/y of SoP production, but are also sufficient to supply gas for our expansion plans to produce 180 000 t/y SoP as well as other potential magnesium byproducts,” said Van Niekerk. Kalium Lakes recently approved the development of the A$250-million Beyondie project.
