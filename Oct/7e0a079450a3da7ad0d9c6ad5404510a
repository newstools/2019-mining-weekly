PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The New South Wales Resources Regulator is launching a new state-wide mine safety campaign aimed at maintaining the safety record of mining in the state. Resources Regulator chief inspector of mines Garvin Burns said the new campaign is the result of an industry-wide roundtable held last year. “While the New South Wales mining industry’s safety record exceeds other high-risk industries and is statistically one of the safest in the world, there is no room for complacency. “Since we convened that roundtable there have tragically been two fatalities at New South Wales mines. “While we do not believe there needs to be a “safety reset” in New South Wales, like is happening in other jurisdictions, it is prudent to take pro-active and renewed steps to keep safety front of mind in New South Wales mining operations,” Burns said. “Through the Mine Safety Advisory Council and New South Wales’s strong approach we are working collaboratively with industry and unions to ensure that all mineworkers go home safe at the end of their shift.” Starting in October, the Resources Regulator is releasing a series of safety resources, including video animations, to be shown to mineworkers by mine operators. The first of these is a video, “Be Safe at Work” developed in partnership with the New South Wales Minerals Council and the mining union CFMMEU. The video focuses on topics including supervision, safety planning, safe equipment and safe systems.
