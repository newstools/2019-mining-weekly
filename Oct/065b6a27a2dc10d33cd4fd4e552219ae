SARAJEVO â€“ Bosnia's 300-MW coal-fired Stanari power plant has been reconnected to the grid after a ten-day overhaul, its British-based operator Energy Financing Team (EFT) said on Wednesday. The overhaul was the second this year to prepare the plant in the northern town of Doboj for winter operation, the company said. The plant, the first privately funded power station in the Western Balkans, came on line in 2016. It has produced 1 523 GWh of electricity so far this year, EFT said.
