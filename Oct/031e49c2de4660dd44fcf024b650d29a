PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed FYI Resources has successfully completed a high purity alumina pilot plant trial in Western Australia. The plant operated continuously from October 2 to 9 on a 24/7 basis, and either met or exceeded the modelled operational performances, demonstrating the potential for commercial production of a high purity alumina, FYI said on Wednesday. “We are really happy with the outcome of our trial production run from our purpose-built heavy high purity alumina pilot plant. We continue to systematically progress the development of our high purity alumina strategy towards the goal of commercial production of this ultra-pure, in-demand product,” said FYI MD Roland Hill. “Through completing the pilot plant trial, we have identified we can further optimise our process, which we expect to have benefit capital and operating costs in the definitive feasibility study.” With the trial now completed, FYI will progress to the next stage of project development, Hill said, which will consist of detailed customer engagement. Following the receipt of final quality assessment, the company will forward the manufactured product to possible offtake partners.
