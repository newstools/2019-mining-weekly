PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Natural gas production at the Roma North project, in the Western Surat Basin, has continued to increase following its commissioning in May, with ASX-listed Senex Energy reporting that it has reached a 11 TJ/d output. The current production levels are up around 40% compared with those achieved at the end of the June quarter. “With 40 wells now on production and up to 40 wells still to be drilled in the current campaign, we are encouraged by Roma North’s production performance and excited about the future of this asset,” said Senex MD and CEO Ian Davies. “In addition to the 258 PJ of 2P reserves in Roma North, Senex holds a further 210 PJ of 2P reserves in the broader Western Surat acreage, providing material future expansion opportunities. “Combined with the commencement of gas production at Project Atlas, Senex is firmly establishing itself as a material east coast gas producer,” Davies said.
