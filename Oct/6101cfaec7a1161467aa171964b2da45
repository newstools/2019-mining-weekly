PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Gold miner Resolute Mining has reported a more than 25 000 oz increase in quarterly production for the three months to September, compared with the June quarter. Gold production in the September quarter reached 103 201 oz, up 25 069 oz on the June quarter, with gold production from the Syama mine, in Mali, accounting for 45 804 oz, consisting of 33 074 oz from the oxide circuit and 12 730 oz from the Syama sulphide circuit. Gold production from the Ravenswood operation remained consistent at 13 206 oz, while the newly acquired Mako mine, also in Mali, delivered 44 191 oz. “Delivering quarterly gold production in excess of 100 000 oz is the new normal for Resolute. Achieving major commissioning milestones at our new underground mine at Syama is encouraging as the team ramp up production to full capacity,” said MD and CEO John Welborn. Resolute was continuing to fine-tune elements of the recovery enhancement project at Syama, dubbed Project 85, with a focus on improving the control methodologies in the flotation circuit. Work is also under way to automate the addition of grinding media to the calcine regrind mill and to improve management of reagent addition to the calcine and float tails leach circuits. “Project 85 remains a critical focus at Syama and while the unscheduled maintenance and repairs conducted during the quarter limited sulphide circuit quarterly production, we remain confident and committed to achieving our processing objectives.” For the full year to date, Resolute’s gold production reached 279 438 oz, with the full year guidance remaining at 400 000 oz at an all-in sustaining cost of $960/oz.
