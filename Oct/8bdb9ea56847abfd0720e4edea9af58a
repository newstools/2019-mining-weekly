Base metals miner Hudbay has appointed Stephen Lang as its chairperson to succeed Alan Hibben, who will resign as chairperson, but remain on the company’s board. Lang is the former CEO of Canadian miner Centerra and also served as that company’s chairperson until he stepped down at the end of last month. Toronto-based Hudbay in May reached an agreement with shareholder Waterton that three of its nominees, including Peter Kukielski, David Smith and Daniel Muñiz Quintanilla, would join the board and that Hibben would resign once a replacement has been found. Hudbay said that its search for a permanent CEO was ongoing. Alan Hair resigned as CEO in July and was replaced by Kukielski – a former CEO of Nevsun Resources – as interim CEO. “We are very pleased that Stephen Lang is joining our board as chair as Hudbay embarks upon a very promising future,” commented Hudbay chair search committee chairperson Carin Knickel. “Stephen has unparalleled experience in mining operations and this, combined with his business and board leadership experience, make him the ideal choice for our board.” Lang has held senior operating positions at a number of companies during his 40-year career in the mining industry, including at Stillwater Mining, Barrick Gold, Rio Algom and Kinross Mining. Lang holds a BSc degree and a Master's degree in mining engineering from the University of Missouri-Rolla.
