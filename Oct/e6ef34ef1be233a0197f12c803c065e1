De Beers Group Auctions, a subsidiary of diamond miner De Beers, on Tuesday launched its new digital auction portal, which is aimed at enhancing customers' bidding experience. “At De Beers Group Auctions, our raison d’etre is to provide our customers a smart and seamless way to source natural diamonds. We plan to do that through continuous improvement of our industry-leading auction platform to allow customers to buy from us online with greater ease and unprecedented levels of product data with greater transparency. "With the new platform, our customers can expect an enhanced customer experience, an integrated portal, a customised experience, and a scalable and robust environment,” said De Beers Group Auctions senior VP James Kirby. The new platform's features include easy navigation, efficient bidding, price protection, transparency and security. Registered buyers can get an overview of all auctions that are happening on the portal and can quickly refer to each lot on offer. They will also be able to see the starting price of a lot, and will be informed if their bids have met the reserve price. "With the price protection and transparency on reserve prices in place, the preliminary bidding round has been eliminated, simplifying the process for the bidders and saving time," De Beers Group Auctions pointed out.
