The government of Lesotho has renewed the mining lease for LSE-listed Gem Diamonds' Letšeng mine for ten years. This followed a statutory negotiation process between Gem and the Lesotho Mining Board. "Gem Diamonds is proud of our long-standing partnership with the government and the people of Lesotho. The mining lease renewal will allow the Letšeng mine to continue to make a significant economic and social contribution to the people of Lesotho. Gem would like to thank the government of Lesotho for its ongoing support and we look forward to continuing the shared value creation long into the future,” comments Gem CEO Clifford Elphick.
