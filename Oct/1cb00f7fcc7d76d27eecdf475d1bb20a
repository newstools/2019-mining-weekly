The illegal blockade that resulted in the suspension of mining at the Peñasquito mine more than three weeks ago, has been lifted, global miner Newmont Goldcorp reported on Wednesday. However, while the blockade had been lifted, operations at the mine remained temporarily suspended, pending further evaluation of the situation on the ground and assurances that the blockade would not be allowed to resume, the gold major said in a statement. ". . . lifting of the blockade paves the way for the government-sponsored dialogue to resume," Newmont Goldcorp said. The blockade had impacted third-quarter production by 11 000 oz of gold, 1.7-million ounces of silver, 13.7-million pounds of lead and 22.8-million pounds of zinc. It would also impact on Peñasquito’s full-year production. The openpit mine, in northern Zacatecas state, produced 272 000 oz of gold in 2018 and directly employs over 6 500 people. Newmont Goldcorp has offered $25-million in community investments and land rental fees to resolve the conflict at Penasquito. Newswire Reuters previously quoted a local leader as saying that communities will accept mining projects, but that they wanted their water back. The miner pointed out on Wednesday that Peñasquito had enhanced water availability for the mine’s 25 neighboring communities through a number of projects, including water treatment plants, new wells, pipelines and water trucks, along with 90 other infrastructure and community development projects. This includes installing and operating a reverse osmosis plant in the Cedros community with a capacity of 600 000 l/d of drinking water. Peñasquito directly employs more than 6 500 people. Since 2005, the company has invested $5-billion in Peñasquito.
