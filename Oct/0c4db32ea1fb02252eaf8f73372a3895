PERTH (miningweekly.com) – South Africa-focused Orion Minerals will raise some A$5.5-million from a share placement to sophisticated and professional investors to fund the completion of a bankable feasibility study (BFS) and early stage work at the Prieska copper/zinc project, in the Northern Cape. The company on Thursday said that it had received firm commitments for the placement of 222-million shares, priced at 2.5c each, with shareholder Tembo Capital Mining Fund and its affiliates subscribing for A$2.5-million of the placement. The share placement falls within Orion’s placement capacity, and will not require shareholder approval. “We are delighted with the support for the capital raising from both existing and new investors, including Tembo Capital. Importantly, the funds raised will be used to take us to the next significant milestones, being completion of optimisation studies on the already positive Prieska copper/zinc project BFS, commencement of Prieska project early works, and progressing the financing negotiations and contracts preparations for the Prieska project,” said Orion chairperson Denis Waddell. The A$378-million Prieska project is expected to produce at a rate of 2.4-million tonnes a year, producing 189 000 t of copper and 580 000 t of zinc in its ten-year foundation phase.
