Exploration company Sienna Resources has started a multi-hole drill programme on its flagship Slättberg nickel, copper and cobalt project in Sweden. “It has been well over a year since our last drill programme and drill results are what the market wants to see. The work programmes over the past few years have enabled us to razor focus the drill programme into the most highly prospective locations for nickel,” commented president Jason Gigliotti. He noted that the strong nickel price had made it an opportune time to be drilling for nickel. Data gathered from the 2018 Slättberg drill programme, in addition to downhole electromagnetic surveys and modern sampling and geophysical work had provided multiple new high priority drill targets. This work programme is fully funded by cash on hand. Slättberg is a historic mining camp hosting nickel/copper/cobalt rich massive sulphide mineralisation that occurs within a 2 km belt of historic nickel/copper mines. The project contains drill defined massive sulphide mineralisation that extends to about 100 m in depth, and remains open for expansion at depth and along strike.
