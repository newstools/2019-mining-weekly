Mobile satellite communications company Inmarsat has joined the Global Mining Guidelines Group (GMG), which encourages collaboration and innovation across the mining sector. GMG brings together representatives from mining companies, regulators and research organisations to discuss challenges, successes and disruptive technologies across the mining industry. As a multi-stakeholder organisation, its aim is to draw on global experience to create guidelines that solve shared problems, encourage innovation and help reach alignment in the sector. “Our membership of GMG is another step in our deeper engagement with the industry and offers GMG a different dimension in their mission to broaden the use of innovative technology and improve safety across the sector. "In particular, joining GMG at the top leadership level enables us to widen the sector’s exposure to new skills and technologies, such as our tailings dam solution, helping make the industry safer and more efficient,” Inmarsat mining innovation director Joe Carr said in a statement on Wednesday. GMG MD Heather Ednie commented that technological innovation was crucial for ensuring the mining industry's longevity and ability to overcome various challenges. "With their global portfolio of satellite networks, Inmarsat’s membership and continued commitment to the sector expands the possibilities for global innovation and improving safety across the mining supply chain. We are excited to welcome them to GMG and look forward to working with them to achieve an innovative, productive, safe and sustainable future for mining," she added.
