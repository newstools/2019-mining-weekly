JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) – Solar technology developer Sola Group has signed a heads of terms agreement with gold miner Harmony Gold for the installation of solar photovoltaic (PV) plants at three of its mines in the Free State. Sola Group head of energy storage and microgrid services Daniel Goldstuck told delegates at the Dwyka Technology Showcase, in Sandton, on Friday, that the solar PV plants would total 26 MW when combined. Harmony CEO Peter Steenkamp said during a presentation in August that the company had been looking into energy supply alternatives for some of its long-life mines in the Free State and had applied to the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (Nersa) for licensing. In May, in Pretoria, Nersa electricity licensing, compliance and dispute resolution head Dennis Seemela said it was ready to consider licence applications for small-scale embedded generator plants of between 1 MW and 10 MW. He said this would be in line with the “blanket deviation” from the Integrated Resources Plan provided by former Energy Minister Jeff Radebe in a letter delivered to Nersa earlier that month. Harmony’s proposed 26 MW solar PV plan – being divided into three separate installations of under 10 MW each – would make it possible for the gold miner to apply for licencing as per the “blanket deviation”. Goldstuck added that, aside from its agreement with Harmony, Sola was actively investigating energy storage solutions for a number of mines in Southern and West Africa.
