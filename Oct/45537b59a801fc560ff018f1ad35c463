Dr Jon Forster intends to step down as West Africa-focused gold exploration company Cora Gold's CEO. The company on Thursday announced that he had expressed his wish to reduce his workload. He will, therefore, remain head of exploration but will eventually step down as CEO. Subject to regulatory due diligence, Robert Monro is expected to succeed Forster as CEO in early 2020.
