PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The Queensland Resources Council (QRC) on Wednesday welcomed the release of an additional 30 000 km2 of land in the Surat, Bowen and Galilee basins thrown open for gas exploration. Energy Minister Dr Anthony Lynham said the 30 000 km2 of new land for exploration was one of the state’s largest ever land releases and includes more than 30% earmarked for domestic supply. “Business and industry – particularly our manufacturers -- need more affordable gas to fuel jobs and there’s one surefire way to do that – produce more gas,” he said. “This is Queensland continuing to do the heavy lifting on gas for the domestic market for jobs.” Six successful ventures have won the right to explore a total of 3 450 km2, two of them for gas for the domestic market only. QRC CEO Ian Macfarlane said the government’s release of land for exploration for all resources was essential to creating jobs, attracting investment, boosting exports and ultimately generating additional revenue for the Queensland government in the form of royalties. “QRC has consistently pushed for extra land to be released for exploration and development. We have been very supportive of the release of areas for exploration and development to service the domestic gas market, supporting industry, jobs and households here in Queensland,” he said. Macfarlane said stable policy, particularly in access to resources and clear approval processes, was essential for the development of the resources sector.
