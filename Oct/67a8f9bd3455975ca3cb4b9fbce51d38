China's commerce ministry granted crude oil import licences to two Zhejiang-based petroleum companies in eastern China, including a trading joint venture partly held by commodities trader Glencore. Zhejiang Petroleum Trading Co and Zhejiang Petroleum & Chemical Co will receive the so-called "non-state" crude oil import licenses on Oct. 14 if there are no objections from the public, the ministry said on its website on Tuesday. Zhejiang Petroleum Trading Co is a joint venture formed by Zhejiang Petroleum, a Zhejiang government-backed firm. The latter holds the majority stake of 71% while Glencore has 29%, according to provincial state media. Zhejiang Petroleum & Chemical Co is a joint venture led by privately-owned Rongsheng Petrochemical Co. The rare crude oil licenses are part of an experiment initiated by the local authorities in Zhoushan, a coastal city picked by Beijing as a pilot zone to build a northeast Asian marine fuel centre as well as a physical trading hub for oil and gas that rivals Singapore. Under that scheme, Zhejiang Wuchan Zhongda Petroleum, a private trading firm based in the Zhoushan free trade zone, was the first private trader to win a similar crude import license. Each license will be attached to an unspecified volume of crude oil import quotas, a local government official has said. Tuesday's Ministry of Commerce note did not give any indication on quotas. China, the worldâ€™s largest crude oil buyer, has since 2015 partially opened its state-oil-dominated crude import market by allowing nearly 40 independent refineries to process foreign oil for the first time, managed under an import quota system.
