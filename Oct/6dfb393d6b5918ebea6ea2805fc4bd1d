The French government has appointed mining engineer Didier Le Moine as new mining delegate and coordinator of mining projects in French Guiana, a move which Canada-listed Columbus Gold has welcomed. Le Moine formerly held the position of director of industry, mines and energy in the French overseas territory of New Caledonia, where a nickel mining industry was successfully established. Mining is French Guiana’s second largest industry, but it is mainly driven by artisanal miners and a few local small to medium-sized companies. Columbus said that the number of mining operators had declined in recent years and the territory was plagued by illegal activity. The arrival of an increasing number of recognised international mining companies and the recent rise in gold price, the mining company said that the territory should implement a mining industry that was environmentally responsible, technically sound, economically efficient. Le Moine’s mandate would require optimising existing structures, such as the responsible mine charter and branch agreements, and create new ones, such as a technical support hub for the industry in the form of a National Technological Research Centre for gold mines, similar to the one created in 2007 for the nickel industry in New Caledonia. “As French Guiana’s leading gold explorer, Columbus embraces the French government’s initiative to appoint a capable delegate to develop and coordinate mining in French Guiana,” said Columbus president and CEO Rock Lefrançois. Columbus holds a major interest in the Montagne d’Or gold deposit.  A feasibility study for Montagne d’Or was filed in May 2017, and the mine permitting process is currently under way. In addition, Columbus has entered into an agreement to acquire a 100% interest in the Rhea gold exploration property and is also earning into the Maripa gold exploration project.
