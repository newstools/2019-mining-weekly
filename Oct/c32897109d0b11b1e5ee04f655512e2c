Mining company Teck Resources said on Sunday that workers at its Teck Carmen de Andacollo Operations (CdA), in Chile, would go on strike, resulting in operations being suspended. The Teck Carmen de Andacollo Workers Union represents 473 workers at CdA and had given notice to start strike action on Monday. In the quarter ended June 30, CdA produced 15 000 t of copper. The previous collective bargaining agreement with the union expired on September 30. Teck and the union subsequently entered into a five-day mediation process, which concluded on Friday without an agreement. The Union of Supervisors and Professionals of Teck CdA reached a new agreement earlier in 2019.
