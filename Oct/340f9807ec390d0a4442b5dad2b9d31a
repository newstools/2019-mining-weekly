Jewellery designer Beaudell Designs' Ester Boshoff and her team were chosen as the overall winners of the professional category of this year's PlatAfrica jewellery design and manufacturing competition. The competition, now in its twentieth year, is one of Anglo American Platinum's (Amplats') flagship market development initiatives and is aimed at promoting innovation and technical expertise in platinum jewellery design and manufacturing in South Africa. “Over the past 20 years, the PlatAfrica awards have enabled hundreds of jewellers in South Africa to work with platinum and develop their skills for the local and international markets. This has created local beneficiation and job creation, and for some, served as a launch platform to enter the international market. "Today, a PlatAfrica award is considered the ultimate accolade in platinum jewellery design on the continent," Amplats CEO Chris Griffith commented in a statement this week. Winners of the competition, presented in association with Platinum Guild International (PGI) India and Metal Concentrators, were announced on Wednesday night. Aimee Bredenkamp from Prins & Prins Diamonds was selected as the runner-up in the professional category, while Chris Janse van Rensburg from Studio C Manufacturing Jewellers placed third and Mandlenkosi Moses None of Mo Nkosi & Nnete Jewellery Manufacturers fourth.

Jane Schoeman, from Stellenbosch University, and The Platinum Incubator’s Nomsa Mpingawere jointly ranked fourth.
