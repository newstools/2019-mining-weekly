About 240 people working at the Langlois mine, in Quebec, are set to lose their jobs as the mine is now considered uneconomic to operate and will cease production in December. Global metals company Nyrstar announced its decision on Monday, explaining that rock conditions had deteriorated to the point of where the mine was no longer economic for zinc and copper ore extraction. “The collective dismissal process is underway in cooperation with the local labour unions,”  Nyrstar said in a statement. The mine near Lebel-Sur-Quévillon, however, has exploration potential for other metals, such as gold. “The company is in active discussions with interested parties in the mine and its assets." The company would reposition some equipment to its mines in Myra Falls and Tennessee. Where possible, employees would also be offered positions at the Myra Falls mine, in Vancouver. Commercial production first started at Langlois in July 2007; however the mine was placed on care-and-maintenance in November 2008. In August 2011, Langlois became the property of Nyrstar through the acquisition of Breakwater Resources. During the first half of 2012, Nyrstar resumed operations after ramping-up the mine through the rehabilitation of the underground mine and surface infrastructure. Langlois produced 24 000 t of zinc concentrate in 2018.
