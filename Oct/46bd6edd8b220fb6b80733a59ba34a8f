PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The Northern Territory Environment Protection Authority (EPA) has recommended approval of the Jervois copper project, being developed by ASX-listed KGL Resources. KGL chairperson Denis Wood on Friday said that the EPA’s approval was a satisfying conclusion to the thorough assessment process, and was the last major regulatory step before final government approval of the mine management plan for Jervois. “As a result of all the hard work our team has done in preparing the environmental impact statement, the recommendations of the EPA as conditions for the project to proceed have been anticipated and will be incorporated into the project development planning and preparation of the mine management plan now being undertaken.” He said that KGL was focused on completing all preliminary processes to allow mine construction to start in the second quarter of 2020. “The mine plan forms the basis of the mine management plan that should be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2020 and requires Northern Territory government approval for the project to proceed. “Other site planning is also under way in parallel with the mine plan, including the provision of power, the water pipeline, the mineral processing plant and the village.” Construction of the Jervois project is estimated to take two years, with the mine anticipated to produce 150 000 t/y of base metal concentrate over a 15-year mine life.
