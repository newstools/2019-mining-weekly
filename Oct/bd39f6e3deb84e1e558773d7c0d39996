PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The share price of ASX-listed Piedmont Lithium was buoyed on Thursday on news that the company had signed a letter of intent with Ion Carbon & Minerals to market the quartz, feldspar and mica produced form the Piedmont lithium project, in the US. The partnership will have exclusive rights to market quartz, feldspar and mica produced at Piedmont under a formal marketing agreement, which will be prepared on mutually agreeable terms and conditions. The partnership will span an initial five-year period, with the option to extend for an additional five years, by mutual agreement. “We are very pleased to be partnering with Ion to develop the markets for our important mineral by-products,” said Piedmont president and CEO Keith Phillips. “Quartz, feldspar and mica represented a significant proportion of the revenue for the lithium mines operated in North Carolina from the 1950s to the 1990s. These are significant and growing markets, particularly in the south-east where much of America’s glass, ceramics and building products production is based.” Phillips said that the Piedmont mine was ideally located to enter into these markets, and should be a low-cost producer given the by-product nature of the activities at the mine.

“We hope to secure important customer relationships over the course of 2020 to provide more clarity to the positive economic impact by-products should have on our project.”
