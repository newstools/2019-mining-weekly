PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Mining titan Anglo American on Thursday undertook a global safety day programme at its Queensland coal mines, with more than 5 000 workers downing tools for dedicated discussions on safety. Anglo American’s metallurgical coal CEO, Tyler Mitchelson, said the day was an important part of the company’s dedication to eliminating fatalities from across the business. “Safety is our core value, and there is nothing more important than making sure every person goes home safely every day. “Despite significant improvements, we still have not been able to eliminate fatalities from our industry. This is something we are focused on every hour of every day, and at every level or our business. “Our annual global safety day ensures that every Anglo American employee is united and aligned on safety,” Mitchelson said. He noted that the company’s focus this year was ensuring there is no gap between what was said and what was done when it came to safety. “We are doing this by ensuring our values always lead our decisions and actions – safety, care & respect, integrity, innovation, accountability and collaboration. “We have introduced a dedicated elimination of fatalities program in our business that is systematically addressing critical safety risks by drawing from best practice knowledge and safety innovations.” Anglo American earlier this year undertook a full safety reset at all of its sites as part of a broader initiative by the mining industry in Queensland.
