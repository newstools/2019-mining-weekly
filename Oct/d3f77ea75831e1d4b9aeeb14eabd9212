President Donald Trump has reportedly granted an extension to the deadline for the delivery of the recommendations of a working group considering ways to support US uranium miners and the nuclear energy industry overall. Citing a US Department of Commerce spokesperson, S&P Global reports that the working group had an extra 30 days to deliver its report. The recommendations had been expected to be provided to Trump by October 10. US uranium miner Energy Fuels said on Wednesday that while it had not been made aware of an official announcement of an extension, it was glad that the group was taking the time it required to complete its review. "By establishing the US nuclear fuel working group, President Trump initiated the most comprehensive review of our nation's nuclear fuel supply chain in decades. While we would like to see quick action from the Trump administration, we are glad to see the working group is taking the time required to get these vitally important issues right,‚Äù said Energy Fuel president and CEO Mark Chalmers. Colorado-based Energy Fuels and Wyoming-based Ur-Energy have lobbied for quotas under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, arguing that imports, particularly from State-owned companies in Russia, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, are a threat to national security. Trump has rejected the 232 trade petition and instead created the working group.
