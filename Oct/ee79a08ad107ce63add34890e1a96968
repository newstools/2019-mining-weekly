The illegal blockade at the El Castillo mine has been lifted and operations at the mine have resumed, TSX-listed Argonaut Gold reported on Wednesday. The company reached a tentative agreement with the Atotonilco ejido that is scheduled to be voted on by the landowners on November 11.Â  As part of the agreement, the Atotonilco ejido agreed to lift the blockade pending ratification. The original agreement that certain members of the ejido tried to amend was signed in 2012 and remained valid until 2022. The agreement was signed and recognised by the Atotonilco ejido and the Mexican government in 2012 and runs through 2022. The El Castillo mine produced 14 758 gold-equivalent ounces in the second quarter.
