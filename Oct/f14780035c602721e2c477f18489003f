PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The Minerals Council of Australia (MCA) this week revealed that it is developing its own Climate Action Plan to support work being done by its members to address human-induced climate change. MCA CEO Tania Constable said that the plan, which will be released in 2020, would complement the already strong commitment by MCA members to act on climate change. “The Australian minerals sector supports a transition to a low emissions global economy. This includes practical actions to support Australia’s commitment to global agreements such as the Paris Agreement, which would hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels. “Strong and practical climate action means reducing emissions in a meaningful, innovative and commercially responsible manner while also supporting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, including universal access to affordable energy,” Constable said. She said that MCA members understood the need to plan for potential future environmental changes which may affect their businesses and the regional communities in which they operate. “The MCA’s long-term work programme will build on the meaningful contributions the sector is already making towards the climate goals of the Paris Agreement, including managing emissions, supporting innovation and enhancing its future resilience to the potential impacts of global warming. “A thriving minerals sector focused on effective and pragmatic climate action is essential to mobilise the solutions required to address climate change. Through the MCA’s Climate Action Plan, the Australian minerals sector is focused on sharing global and domestic knowledge on what the sector is doing and what can be done further to help address climate change.”
