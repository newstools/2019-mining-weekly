LSE-listed Pembridge Resources has brought back to operation the Minto openpit and underground copper/gold/silver mine, in Canada’s Yukon, with the first new copper concentrates produced on October 11. Milling operations started on October 10. Raiseboring of the Minto East vent raise was completed on October 1, and the schedule also sees the mill now operating in alternating two week phases – two weeks on, two weeks off – until sufficient development has been achieved underground to enable higher monthly processing capacity. The first underground blasting occurred in the Minto East mining area on October 13, and 32 279 t of ore is expected to be blasted over the next seven days. CEO and chairperson Gati Al-Jebouri said this week that it was the first step in ramping up Minto to its full capacity and generating value for all stakeholders. Pembridge bought Minto Explorations from Capstone Mining in June, and will pay cash instalments totalling $20-million to the Canadian company. “The Pembridge team are committed to operating safely, efficiently, with consideration for the environment and cost effectively with the long-term aim of extending the life-of-mine and realising the full potential that Minto has,” Al-Jebouri stated.
