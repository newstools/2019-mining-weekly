PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Mining stalwart David Flannagan has been appointed to the board of ASX-listed Magmatic Resources as an independent nonexecutive director. The company on Monday said that Flanagan’s experience in exploration and development of mines would greatly enhance Magmatic’s capabilities as it enters into a new phase at its four East Lachlan gold and porphyry copper/gold exploration projects. “Flanagan has a strong track record, from greenfields exploration, project development, strategic planning to marketing, and has a broad range of global industry contacts,” said MD David Richardson. “We are delighted that he has agreed to join our board and we look forward to his contribution in what is a very exciting period of the company’s evolution as we progress planning our drill programme at our East Lachlan projects.” Flanagan is a geologist with more than 25 years' experience, and is currently the nonexecutive chairperson of ASX-listed Battery Minerals. From 2004 to 2016 he helmed iron-ore miner Atlas Iron, taking the company from exploration to shipping 15-million tonnes a year.
