Vancouver-based M3 Metals has secured an option to acquire a 100% right, title and interest in the Mohave mine gold project, which comprises a number of historic gold mines in the Weaver mining district. The project consists of 160 claims, including lode claims and mill-site claims. In addition to the historic gold mines on the project, there is an about 5 km gold-in-soil and gold-in-rock geochemical anomaly that extends across the entire length. M3 Metals says large areas of the anomalous gold geochemistry, including several historic gold mines, have not had any modern exploration or drilling. The junior explains that more than 550 drill holes had been drilled on the claims. All these have been done in the northern one-fourth of the property, and most of these holes were shallow, 100 ft-deep, air-track holes, many of which stopped in mineralisation. Previous development work includes blasting of an initial bench at the Klondyke mine, representing the beginning of openpit-style operations. The blasted material remains stockpiled next to the primary jaw crusher located at the 350 t/h crushing facility that remains on the project’s mill-site claims where heap-leach infrastructure including a heap-leach pad, buildings, a jaw crusher, two cone crushers and a conveyor system were installed. M3 states that significant potential for identifying and defining new mineralised areas remains as is evident from widespread elevated gold-in-soil and mineralised rock outcrops occurring across the project. “We are extremely pleased with the acquisition of this advanced-stage project that still has significant upside.  Historically the private owners were focused on development and did not test the numerous remaining targets on the project for its larger potential. We are eager to begin an aggressive drilling campaign on the extensive target areas on the southern portion of the property while expanding on those to the north,” says M3 president Adrian Smith.
