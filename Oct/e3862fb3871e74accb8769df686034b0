NYSE- and JSE-listed Sibanye-Stillwater has successfully refinanced its R6-billion revolving credit facility (RCF) that would have matured on November 15. The new three-year R5.5-billion RCF has been issued on similar terms, with an option that allows for a future upsize to R7.5-billion. Additionally, there is an option to extend the tenor through two further one-year extensions. The new RCF is made possible through a syndicate of local and international banks, led by Absa and Nedbank.
