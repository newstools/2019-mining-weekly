PERTH (miningweekly.com) â€“ Base metals miner New Century Resources has reported a 28% increase in zinc metal production for the September quarter, as production at its namesake project, in Queensland, continues to ramp up. The Century mine delivered 26 171 t of zinc metal during the September quarter, at a C1 cash cost of $1/lb, which was down 18% on the previous quarter. The miner noted on Tuesday that consistent quarter-on-quarter C1 cash cost reductions, averaging 15%, had been achieved since operations began in the second quarter of this year. Further improvements to both metallurgical recoveries and metal production rates were expected during the 2020 financial year, as the project continues to expand to its 12-million-tonne-a-year capacity. New Century is also expecting improvements during the December quarter of this year, from the continued optimisation of the upgraded cleaner circuit and the implementation of the new scavenger circuit upgrade. During the December quarter, the Century mine is expected to produce between 27 000 t and 33 000 t of zinc metal, with C1 costs of between 87c/lb and 98c/lb.
