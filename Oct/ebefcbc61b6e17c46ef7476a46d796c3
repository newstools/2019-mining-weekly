PERTH (miningweekly.com) â€“ The share price of gold miner St Barbara stumbled on Friday after the company revised its production expectations for the Gwalia project for the 2020 financial year, while also raising the anticipated all-in sustaining costs (AISC) for the operation. The ASX-listed company on Friday said that near-term production from Gwalia would be impacted by strained infrastructure, as the remaining Gwalia extension project construction and raise-boring programme was competing for constrained ventilation with the scheduled production and development activities. Once completed in the third quarter of 2020, the extension project would double the underground ventilation, enabling increased development and production. However, while the extension project is still undergoing, St Barbara has downgraded the production expectations at Gwalia from the previously targeted 200 000 oz to 210 000 oz, to between 175 000 oz and 190 000 oz. AISC for the full 2020 are also expected to increase from the initial estimate of between A$1 230.oz and A$1 290/oz, to between A$1 390/oz and A$1 450/oz. Meanwhile, St Barbara on Friday said that production from recently acquired Atlantic Gold is expected to add between 95 000 oz and 105 000 oz to the production profile in 2020, while AISC at the Canadian operation has been estimated at between A$900/oz and A$955/oz. St Barbara has estimated a sustaining capital expenditure of between A$13-million and A$17-million for the Atlantic Gold operation in the 2020 financial year, along with an exploration budget of between A$11-million and A$13-million. St Barbara shares were trading at a low of A$2.52 a share on Friday, up from a high of A$2.70 a share.
