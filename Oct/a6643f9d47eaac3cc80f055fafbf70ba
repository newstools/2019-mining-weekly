De Beers Canada has started preliminary drilling at properties near the town of Cobalt, in Ontario. De Beers is drilling at TSX-V-listed Tri Originâ€™s Nipissing Cobalt and South Abitibi project, near Cobalt. This will be the first time that these targets will be tested, the junior said on Tuesday. The initial target will be evaluated and the Nipissing Cobalt property and the drill will then be moved to the South Abitibi property for a second drilling programme. Tri Origin said that the geological environment was prospective for Abitibi-type gold and base metal deposits and hosts the nearby Kirkland Lake and Noranda mining districts to the north, Cobalt mining district to the east and Sudbury mining district to the south. The property is within a large-scale crustal corridor and historically, diamondferrous kimberlite has been identified throughout the region.
