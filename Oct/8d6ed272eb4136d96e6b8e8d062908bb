LONDON â€“ Vedanta Resources said on Thursday it would shut its Skorpion zinc operations in Namibia from early November until the end of February 2020. The company said in a statement the closure was due to technical problems which resulted in reduced ore production at the Skorpion site. Skorpion expected to produce around 90 000 t of zinc last year, according to Vedanta's website. The global zinc market is around 14-million tonnes a year. Benchmark zinc on the London Metal Exchange was up 3.7% at $2 375/t at 15:43 GMT, outperforming other industrial metals.
