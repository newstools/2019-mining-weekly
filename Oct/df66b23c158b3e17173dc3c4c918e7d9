Aim-listed BlueRock Diamonds has sold the 20.72 ct diamond recovered from its Kareevlei mine, in South Africa, in September, for $236 000, or $11 389/ct. This is the highest value achieved for the mine to date for a single diamond, surpassing the previous record sale of $190 000 for a 24.8 ct diamond. “I am pleased with the recovery and sale of yet another high-value diamond, which continues to underpin the increasing potential of the Kareevlei mine,” comments executive chairperson Mike Houston.
