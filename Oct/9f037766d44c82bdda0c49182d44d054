PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Bass Metals has reported record production from its Graphmada graphite mine, in Madagascar, during the three months to September. The company on Wednesday reported that 1 128 wet tonnes of graphite were produced in the three months to September, up from the 1 005 t produced in the June quarter, with critically large flake production increasing to 42% of production for the quarter under review, materially exceeding the 32% large flake production achieved in the June quarter. Bass told shareholders that the Graphmada mining complex benefited from a capital investment that was made earlier this year. The company noted that 63 321 t of ore was mined during the quarter under review, a 200% increase on the June tonnage, substantially increasing ore stockpiles for future processing. During the quarter, 34 699 t of ore was processed at an average head grade of 3.6% fixed carbon, resulting in the record production. “The team at Graphmada has proven that large flake production at premium final concentrate grades is sustainable. A strong culture of continuous improvement in growing production volumes and concentrate quality, while lowering operating costs, is driving significant strategic interest in Bass,” said CEO Tim McManus. “Bass continues to be able to offer opportunities to end-users that other companies at present are not able to: existing production, established and growing sales channels, a recognised and accepted product, high and increasing volumes of large flake production, and an ever-growing expertise in mining, processing and the selling of graphite.” He noted that with sustainable production and growing strategic interest, Bass is setting a substantial foundation for the next critical stage of growth.
