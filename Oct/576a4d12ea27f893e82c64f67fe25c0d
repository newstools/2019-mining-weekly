PERTH (miningweekly.com) â€“ A detailed technical review of the Way Linggo gold project, in Indonesia, has extended the mine life of the openpit Talang Santo operation, ASX-listed Kingrose Mining reported. Mining at Talang Santo was initially expected to continue until December this year, while gold production would continue until June 2020, as stockpiled ore from Talang Santo was blended with stockpiled ore from Way Linggo. However, following the review, the openpit mine life has now been extended until July 2020, with gold production expected to continue from stockpiled ore until September 2020, with the openpit operation expected to deliver 16 400 oz during this financial year. Kingsrose on Thursday said that the current pit at Talang Santo was essentially a stage pit for the further cutbacks under review, with the new extension considered to be low- to medium-risk design. Further cutbacks and optimum designs will continued to be reviewed, the miner said. Meanwhile, mining at the Way Linggo openpit mine is still scheduled to run until December this year, with gold production to continue until June 2020 from stockpiled ore. The Way Linggo pit is expected to produce some 15 700 oz before being rehabilitated. Kingsrose told shareholders that two deep diamond drillholes were scheduled for November this year, to test below the underground workings. Previous underground mining at Way Linggo stopped at 175 m below the surface, with Kingsrose saying that there was strong potential for further mineralisation below the previous underground mine.
