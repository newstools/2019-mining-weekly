The Canadian Mining Hall of Fame (CMHF) in January will welcome four new individuals, who have made lasting contributions to Canada’s mining industry. The new members are Jerry Asp, one of western Canada’s most prominent Indigenous leaders and an advocate for the inclusion of Indigenous peoples in the mining industry; Alex Balogh, who helped build Noranda and Falconbridge into the most successful mining and metallurgical giants in Canadian history; Hans Lundberg, a pioneer in the development and application of geophysical and geochemical methods; and Eberhard Scherkus, who worked for 27 years at Agnico Eagle Mines, serving as president and COO for many years. “The Canadian Mining Hall of Fame is proud to recognise four leaders who drove the Canadian mining industry forward and greatly contributed to Canadian society overall,” says CMHF chairperson Jon Baird. “Each of these inductees, representing different facets of our industry, is an exemplary leader who future generations can follow, while they work to grow and sustain responsible mining in Canada and beyond.” Each of these individuals will be honoured at the CMHF’s dinner and induction ceremony on January 9 in Toronto. For the past 32 years, the CMHF has recognised 186 exemplary men and women who have demonstrated outstanding achievement, leadership and inspired future generations in mining.
