Australia's Kibaran Resources Ltd said on Tuesday its proposed production facility at Kwinana, near Perth in Western Australia, would manufacture battery graphite worth A$72-million a year for export. The company said an engineering study had found the plant would be financially and technically robust, and it forecast an up-front capital cost of A$22.8-million for initial production of 5 000 t/y. Further out, production could be expanded to 20 000 t/y of battery-grade graphite at a cost of A$49.2-million, it said. The graphite processed at the facility will be exported to lithium-ion battery customers in Asia, Europe and the United States. The graphite-focused explorer said the plant was estimated to generate annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of A$35-million. Kibaran will now seek to secure funding and environmental approvals for the facility, it said in a statement. Asian battery manufacturers have been turning to battery metals miners in Australia, ahead of expected shortages as demand for electric vehicles revs up.
