Intermediate gold miner Endeavour Mining has appointed Anglo American base metals executive Louis Irvine as CFO, succeeding Vincent Benoit, who is rejoining Endeavour’s main shareholder, La Mancha Group, on August 1. Immediately prior to joining Endeavour, Irvine was executive head of strategy and business development for base metals at diversified major Anglo American. Prior to that, he has held a number of executive finance roles at international mining companies, including BHP Billiton (CFO for carbon steel materials), Xstrata (CFO of Xstrata Copper) and Anglo American (CFO for the copper business). “Irvine’s strong financial track record with leading international mining companies will be of significant benefit to Endeavour as we continue to grow,” said Endeavour president and CEO Sebastien de Montessus. He also thanked Benoit for his contribution to the Africa-focused miner since 2016. “He has played a key role in building and executing our strategy by increasing the quality of our portfolio through divestments and acquisitions, and in reshaping our balance sheet to fund our growth. I wish him success in his new role at La Mancha,” said De Montessus.
