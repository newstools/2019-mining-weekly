RIO DE JANEIRO â€“ Brazilian miner Vale is considering building a new railway and port in the Para state for the potential expansion of its Carajas Serra Sul mine, the company said in a presentation to investors published on Tuesday. The new railway would stretch for 400 km from the current Carajas railroad to Vila do Conde port, in the northeastern Brazilian state of Maranhao. Vale said last month that it was considering doubling production at Serra Sul Carajas, where its giant S11D mine is located, to 150-million tonnes a year.
