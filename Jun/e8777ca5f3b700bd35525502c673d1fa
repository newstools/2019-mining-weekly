The town of Florence, in Arizona, in the US, has been ordered to pay Taseko Mines’ Florence copper mine attorney’s fees and costs after its legal challenge failed in court last week. The Superior Court of Arizona has ordered that Florence Copper be awarded $1.7-million in attorneys’ fees and $32 365.55 in costs. The town had challenged the company’s right to mine on its own property and lost the case. Taseko said in a statement on Wednesday that a judge had ruled last week that Florence had successfully demonstrated that it had a vested right to mine copper in the BHP mine overlay area. The town had reportedly claimed that the company had lost its right to mine when the town passed new zoning restrictions. Florence Copper won its first litigation case in this matter in January.
