Aim-listed African Battery Metals on Friday reported the identification of a copper anomaly related to the undifferentiated roan horizons passing through the length of its Kisinka copper/gold licence area in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). In a statement on Friday, African Battery Metals executive director Paul Johnson said the potential significance of this large anomalous zone made this a high-priority prospect for the company. “Initial exploration in 2018 had failed to pick up significant signs of any mineralisation and so this appears to be a positive change in fortunes,” he said. X-ray fluorescence spectrometry analysis had been carried out to identify anomalous levels of copper and cobalt on the 663 field samples, plus standards of known composition and blanks. Preliminary analysis identified a 7-km-long anomalous zone for copper which is spatially related to the undifferentiated roan horizons within the licence area. Undifferentiated roan represents roan rocks of the roan 1, roan 2 and roan 3 subgroups and the neoproterozoic roan group of central Africa is host to the world’s largest and highest-grade sedimentary rock-hosted copper/cobalt deposits in the copperbelts of Zambia and the DRC. Further analysis and review of the copper and cobalt results from sampling will continue over the next week.
