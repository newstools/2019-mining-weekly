PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Salt Lake Potash has completed the construction of a commercial-scale sulphate of potash (SoP) brine evaporation pond at its Lake Way operation, in Western Australia, and has started the evaporation process. The evaporation ponds have been designed to receive the 1.2 GL of high-grade SoP brine from the Williamson Pit mine, with de-watering of the pit scheduled for completion in the third quarter of this year. Salt Lake told shareholders that given the super-saturated nature of the Williamson Pit brines, precipitation of sales started immediately upon pumping into the evaporation pond, with the first salts harvested from the brine to be used as initial feedstock for processing. “It is very pleasing to see the high-grade Williamson Pit brines being pumped into the commercial-scale SoP evaporation ponds. It’s a real milestone in the development of our Lake Way project and a first in the development of an exciting new industry for Western Australia,” said Salt Lake CEO Tony Swiericzuk. The company has, meanwhile, launched a bankable feasibility study for a commercial scale 200 000 t/y SoP development at Lake Way, targeted for completion also in the third quarter.
