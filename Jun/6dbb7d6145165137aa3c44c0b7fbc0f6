Aim-listed IronRidge Resources has concluded additional X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of metallurgical composites from its Ewoyaa project surrounds, in Ghana, which reaffirmed spodumene as the dominant lithium mineral phase within the Cape Coast lithium portfolio. IronRidge said that, with the majority of lithium reports confirming spodumene as the dominant phase, it provides confidence in using a simple process flow-sheet design and ensures good customer acceptance, as spodumene has low trade amounts of undesirable petalite, eucryptite, lepidolite and amblygonite. COO Len Kolff noted that the XRD results for ten of the company’s metallurgical composites had continued to provide confidence in favourable spodumene consistency across the deposit footprint. “All results to date point towards a simplified process flow-sheet design with remarkable mineralogical consistency in all ten metallurgical composites analysed.” This should ease the company into completing the pending Ewoyaa mine plan.
