Battery-grade lithium hydroxide has been successfully produced from the Rhyolite Ridge project, in Nevada, using standard commercial processes, Australia-based ioneer reported on Tuesday. The testwork, undertaken by lithium processing technology group Veolia Water Technologies, confirmed the key flowsheet parameters for the Rhyolite Ridge lithium/boron project and completed the key steps of the definitive feasibility study (DFS). The testwork confirmed that Rhyolite Ridge would be able to produce a range of products at the mine site, including boric acid, lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide, ioneer MD Bernard Rowe commented in a media statement. “Using the technical-grade lithium carbonate produced from Rhyolite Ridge DFS flowsheet, Veolia has successfully completed bench-scale testing to support the commercial application for crystallising battery-grade lithium hydroxide,” he stated. The DFS is evaluating the range of potential Rhyolite Ridge lithium products to determine which provides the most commercial benefits. The study will be completed in the third quarter. ioneer was formerly known as Global Geoscience and trades on the ASX.
