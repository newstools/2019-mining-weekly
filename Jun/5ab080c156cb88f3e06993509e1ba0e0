The Gert Sibande District Municipal Planning Tribunal has approved Atha-Africa Ventures’ application for a land use change to allow for the construction of the Yzermyn underground coal mine. “Atha-Africa is extremely pleased with the decision, as this particular authorisation was the last outstanding authorisation for the Yzermyn mine,” Atha-Africa senior VP Praveer Tripathi said in a statement on Tuesday. Atha-Africa has now obtained all statutory approvals required for mine development to proceed. The company recently had a water use licence for the mine confirmed by the National Water Tribunal. It also won the appeal against the granting of an environmental authorisation for the mine. Atha-Africa said it would soon engage with the community to apprise it of further developments regarding the construction of the mine.
