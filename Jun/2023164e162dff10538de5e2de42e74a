TSX- and Nasdaq-listed Mountain Province Diamonds has discovered a new kimberlite at its Gahcho Kué joint venture (JV) leases – the first to be discovered in the area in more than two decades. The Wilson kimberlite, which was named after Canada’s first female geologist, Alice Evelyn Wilson, is located about 200 m east of the Tuzo kimberlite and is well within the openpit mine plan for Tuzo. “The discovery of Wilson demonstrates the high exploration potential of the Gahcho Kué JV area, and after a 20-year discovery hiatus, it confirms that we are on track for discovering new kimberlites in this region. This discovery also heightens our focus on the potential for more discoveries in the corridor between the Gahcho Kué JV and the Kelvin-Faraday kimberlites,” Mountain Province president and CEO Stuart Brown said on Tuesday. The Wilson kimberlite was discovered during an exploration drilling programme that was designed to conduct drill-testing of geophysical and historical drilling anomalies in the area surrounding the Gahcho Kué kimberlites.
