The Department of Mineral Resources and Energy has accepted JSE-listed Bauba Platinum’s application for a prospecting right in respect of chrome and platinum group metals (PGMs) over the farm Hartebeesfontein 445JQ, in Brits, in the North West. The prospecting right is expected to be granted imminently. Moreover, the department has granted an environmental authorisation over the farm. While appeals have been lodged by two third parties against the granting of the environmental authorisation, Bauba said in a statement on Thursday that its board remained cautiously optimistic that both appeals would shortly be decided on in favour of the company. Chrome-bearing Middle Group (MG) chromitite layers in the upper critical zone of the Bushveld Complex are present on the farm. Initial desktop studies have revealed that the MG layers on the farm are present in the so-called “Brits Graben”, intersected by several subparallel faults. The orebodies may have a dip of about 20° to 26° east of northeast and presently host the potential for an opencast strike length of 2.7 km on the farm. Allowances for losses owing to infrastructure or environmental sensitivity have not been assessed.
