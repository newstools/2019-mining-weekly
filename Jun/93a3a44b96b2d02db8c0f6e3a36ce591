South Australia has earmarked A$10-million for the accelerated exploration of the state’s yet-to-be identified mineral resources, Energy and Mining Minister Dan van Holst Pellekaan announced on Tuesday. The Accelerated Discovery Fund (ADF) would not be limiting the benefit of cofounding to only a single entity, but would seek to share the knowledge, know-how and broader economic benefits with other explorers and industries. “The ADF along with data from our world-class South Australia drill core reference library, will drive the next round of cutting-edge exploration and possibly South Australia’s next major mineral discovery,” Van Holst Pellekaan said ahead of the 2019/20 state Budget. The ADF would focus on: “By accelerating our knowledge and adopting cutting-edge technology, we’ll help bring additional mines to market sooner, and more growth to South Australia," said Van Holst Pellekaan. Minerals Council of Australia CEO Tania Constable said that the A$10-million investment in promoting exploration and innovative technologies was a welcome development, noting that it should accelerate new mining investment. In 2017/18, A$55-million was invested on mineral exploration in South Australia. Mining currently accounts for 35% of South Australia’s exports of traded goods.
