Global industrial company Metso is considering the potential closure of, or other alternatives for, its foundry operation in Isithebe, in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. The Isithebe foundry produces metallic wear part castings for the mining and aggregates industries and employs about 200 people. The foundry’s possible closure forms part of the evaluation of Metso’s global supply footprint development strategy in its Minerals Consumables business area. “Our strategy is to [use the] synergies of the most efficient manufacturing and sourcing opportunities globally,” commented Metso Minerals Consumables president Sami Takaluoma in a statement issued on Tuesday. “We are continuously developing our supply footprint to deliver the best value, availability and quality for our customers,” Takaluoma added. In addition to Isithebe, Metso has five other foundries in Brazil, China, the Czech Republic and India and an extensive global network of external suppliers.
