PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed TNG has inked a binding heads of agreement with rail operator Genesee & Wyoming Australia (GWA) to provide rail haulage services for the Mt Peake vanadium/titanium/iron project, in the Northern Territory. The agreement covers the transport of magnetite concentrate produced at the Mt Peake mine site from the proposed Adnera rail siding to the TIVAN processing facility in Darwin. The scope of the services also extends to the transport of three end-products produced at the TIVAN facility to the Darwin port, before shipping to TNG customers. GWA will provide all the necessary rail transport plant and equipment, including locomotives, wagons, crew vans and fuelling equipment. TNG MD Paul Burton on Thursday said that the signing of the MoA with GWA was a cornerstone of the logistics chain for the Mt Peake project, and marked an important step in its development strategy. "We are delighted to have engaged GWA as Mt Peake’s rail haulage service provider. GWA’s presence and expertise in logistics and transportation further strengthens TNG’s global network of high-quality partners assigned for the development and operation of Mt Peake.” Mt Peake is forecast to produce 243 000 t of high purity vanadium pentoxide, 3.5-million tonnes of titanium pigment and 10.6-million tonnes of iron oxide over a 17-year mine life.
