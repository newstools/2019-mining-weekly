The Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency has concluded that TSX-listed Treasury Metals’ proposed Goliath gold project, in north-western Ontario, is not likely to cause significant adverse environmental effects. The agency has published its draft environmental assessment report for a 30-day public comment period, following which it will submit a final report and potential conditions to Environment and Climate Change Minister Catherine McKenna. "With the significant resources our company and stakeholders have invested in the environmental approval process, the full value of our advanced gold development project in north-western Ontario is near to being realised," said Treasury CEO Greg Ferron. Treasury is planning an initial openpit development to feed a 2 500 t/d processing plant, with subsequent underground operations in the latter years of the 12-year mine life. According to the draft environmental assessment report, Treasury is proposing an openpit and underground gold mine about 20 km east of Dryden, with an ore production capacity of 5 424 t/d. Over 12 years of operations, the average ore production and ore input capacity of the mine and mill would be 2 700 t/d. Ore would be processed on site to produce a final doré bar that would be shipped off site for further refining and upgrading.
