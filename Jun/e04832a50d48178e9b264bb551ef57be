PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Explorer Oklo Resources has exercised its option to acquire a 65% interest in the Sari gold project, in Mali. Under the terms of a 2018 agreement, Oklo has now exercised its rights by paying €15 245. The company could increase its shareholding in the project area to 100% by paying a further €15 000 or equivalent in Oklo shares by June 2020. Oklo told shareholders on Wednesday that the acquistion of the Sari project was central to its broader strategy to acquire a significant landholding in the Birimian gold belt, where it currently holds some 500 km2 of prospective ground. “Oklo’s strategy of building a significant foothold in this prolific region has delivered exceptionally well,” said MD Simon Taylor. “We have already confirmed two bedrock gold discoveries at Kouroufing and first pass geochemical auger drilling at the adjoining Sari and Kossaya projects shows anomalous gold within these permits as well. We look forward to continued exploration across this recently acquired land package.”
