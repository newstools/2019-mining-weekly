Aim-listed W Resources would start commissioning its larger-scale La Parrilla concentrator next month, it said on Friday, reporting that construction completion was imminent. The primary construction of the concentrator spiral and shaking table buildings are complete and the smaller flotation magnetic and electrostatic separation building will be completed in early July. Commissioning would start in mid-July, following the installation of the motor control centre, the company affirmed in a project update. W reported that commissioning of the jig and mill was proceeding well. The jig was upgrading crushed ore grades and rejecting waste mass in line with expectations. The company is trucking pre-concentrate from the jig to the existing La Parrilla concentrator, which has now moved to 24-hour operation. The existing La Parrilla concentrator plant will be moved from Spain to W’s Réguam project, in Portugal, at a later stage.
