In its pursuit to declare a mineral resource estimate for the Uis tin mine, in Namibia, Aim-listed AfriTin Mining has shared the remaining assay results over ten holes from its resource validation drilling programme. Significant intercepts from drilling on the project’s V1 and V2 pegmatites include 40.50 m at 0.15% tin and 108 parts per million (ppm) of tantalum, 108 m at 0.17% tin and 56 ppm tantalum, and 86 m at 0.16% tin and 69 ppm tantalum. CEO Anthony Viljoen said the conclusion of the confirmatory drilling programme was a significant milestone towards the declaration of a mineral resource estimate. He added that, “importantly, from this set of results, an intersection of 108.97 m at 0.17% tin, indicates that the V1 and V2 pegmatites thicken with depth. In addition, the notable grades of the ancillary elements point to the potential for multiple revenue streams as the project advances."
