Aim- and TSX-V-listed Altus Strategies has discovered a new gold prospect, Wedi Keshi, at its Daro copper/gold/silver volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS) project, in northern Ethiopia. Altus CEO Steven Poulton says the Wedi Keshi prospect has been mapped for about 2 km in length and 300 m in width and that it is also coincident with a series of discontinuous hard gold workings in the area. Follow-up exploration will include channel and trench sampling to define potential drill targets. Concurrent with the discovery of Wedi Keshi, a reconnaissance ground gravity survey has been completed along an initial 300 m section of the 2.5 km long Teklil VMS prospect at Daro. “The survey identified a potentially significant gravity anomaly adjacent to key VMS markers, including a gossanous outcrop sample which returned 6.95% copper, units with sulphide stockworks and jasperoid,” Poulton says, adding that ground gravity surveys have proven instrumental in discovering a number of VMS deposits. These include Bisha, a copper/gold/zinc mine operated by Zijin Mining, located 190 km northwest of Daro.
