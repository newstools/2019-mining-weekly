Construction services provider ELB Construction (ELBCon) has been awarded a contract by Turnmill Proquip Equipment to install four leach vats, as well as associated structural steel, at Glencore’s Rhovan vanadium mine, in the North West. The mine’s aged leach vats are becoming obsolete and will need to be decommissioned. The new vats would be installed in sequence. “The erection strategy is closely aligned with the logistics strategy in as much as it will be one of sequential and continuous delivery and erection,” ELBCon said in a statement this week. ELBCon’s portion of the construction work is set to take place over six months, with the company’s scope of work having increased with the addition of construction of the new leach vats’ associated winch structures and quench building, which will be executed concurrently with the construction of the vat project. The scope of work also includes the skid jacking, installation, alignment and torqueing of four 40-m-long, 260 t free issue completely assembled leach vats. All structural steel installation for the leach vats, as well as the installation and grouting of walkways and hand-railing, will also be done by ELBCon.
