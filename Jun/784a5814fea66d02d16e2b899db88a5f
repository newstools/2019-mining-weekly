Six new member companies have joined the Hydrogen Council, a global CEO-led initiative for hydrogen technologies. The council now has 60 members after BP joined as a steering member and AVL, Itochu Corporation, Liebherr Group, Power Assets Holdings and SinoHytec joined as supporting members. The coalition has more than quadrupled since its launch in 2017 with 13 founding members. Covering all key geographies and sectors, the council uses its global reach to provide guidance on scaling hydrogen use around the world. “The global hydrogen industry is stronger than ever. Businesses are betting on hydrogen, investing in multibillion-dollar projects and developing new products. Hydrogen Council members are leading this effort and working to increase cooperation between industry, government and investors,” says Hyundai Motor Group executive vice-chairperson and Hydrogen Council co-chairperson Euisun Chung. “Hydrogen will play an important role in a low-carbon future, both as an energy product and as an industrial feedstock. BP is pleased to be joining the Hydrogen Council and will work with its members to promote and develop large-scale, low-carbon hydrogen-based opportunities,” BP CE Bob Dudley adds.
