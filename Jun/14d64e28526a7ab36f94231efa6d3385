PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Gold miner OceanaGold has rubbished reports that production at the Didipio mine, in the Philippines, has been halted. The denial followed reports from an environmental organisation that claimed the provincial government of Nueva Vizcaya had ordered a stop to operations, in the wake of its financial and technical assistance agreement (FTAA) expiring at the end of June. OceanaGold on Friday denied the claims saying it had lodged an application to renew the FTAA with the Philippines government in March, and had received confirmation on June 20 from the Mines and Geosciences Bureau that the Didipio operation is permitted to continue operations pending the confirmation of the FTAA renewal. “The company is committed to operating in accordance with the law and will always comply with its responsibilities under its contract with the Philippine government,” the TSX and ASX-listed gold miner said.
