Copper miner Taseko Mines on Friday announced several senior management changes, including the appointment of current CFO Stuart McDonald as its new president – a position that Russell Hallbauer previously held. Hallbauer, who was president and CEO, would remain as CEO of the company. Further, Bryce Hamming, currently director of corporate finance, has been made CFO, while Richard Tremblay, currently the VP and general manager of the Gibraltar mine, in Canada, would become VP of operations. In a statement announcing the changes, Hallbauer said that MacDonald had been with the company for six years and, over that time, he had been taking on more responsibilities to prepare for the role of president. “Having successfully led the bond refinancing in 2017 and other finance and corporate development initiatives, he is well suited for raising the necessary capital to allow the company to move forward with our growth strategy. Bryce, whose career has included corporate finance roles in mining and similar industries as well as banking, will also be an important part of the management team going forward," said Hallbauer. He added that Tremblay’s appointment would enhance the operational strength of Taseko’s head office. “Along with John McManus, our COO, we have the necessary skills and experience to advance our projects through to becoming operating assets."
