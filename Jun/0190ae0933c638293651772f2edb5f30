JSE- and TSX-V-listed Alphamin Resources has completed C4 commissioning at its Bisie tin projectâ€™s processing plant, in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The C4 commissioning involved feeding the system with material, checking instrumentation calibration, process flows and individual equipment throughput, and building up to design throughput. A C4 certificate indicated that a unit or the entire system was complete and could operate with material. Next, Alphamin is pursuing C5 commissioning, which will be the final stage of the commissioning process. This will be achieved when the facility runs at full nameplate production capacity for 48 hours. Attaining C5 and the ramp-up to nameplate capacity was taking longer than expected, as aspects of the processing plant have been refined and optimised, says Alphamin. The company expects to achieve nameplate capacity during the second half of the year. To avoid requiring any additional funding, Alphamin will need to produce around 800 t of concentrate a month from July.
