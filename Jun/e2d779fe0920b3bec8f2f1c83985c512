Aim-listed AfriTin Mining has received the second batch of assay results as part of a resource validation drilling programme at its Uis tin mine, in Namibia. The programme was aimed at validating the historic information disclosed by SRK in 1985 and designed to support the declaration of a maiden, Joint Ore Reserves Committee-compliant mineral resource estimate on the V1 and V2 pegmatites at the mine. Significant intersections include 30.32 m at 0.20% tin and 91 ppm tantalum in drill hole V1V2008; 109.32 m at 0.17% tin and 77 ppm tantalum in drill hole V1V2010; and 53.83 m at 0.16% tin and 73 ppm tantalum in drill hole V1V20011. The intersections indicate an increase in the thickness of the pegmatites with depth, a trend that is also reflected in the historic drill programme.
