Metals and mining company Nyrstar extended a production stoppage at its Port Pirie lead and zinc smelter in Australia, it said on Friday. The force majeure will continue into July 2019, the Belgium-based company said in a statement, adding that it expects now both TSL and Blast furnaces to restart in the second week of July. The production was halted on May 28 due to an unplanned outage at the blast furnace, the company said on June 7, adding that it expected that production would resume within days. Nyrstar said it was still assessing the impact of the outage but reiterated that the extended shutdown would have a material negative impact on production at Port Pirie and underlying earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA). Port Pirie produced 160 000 t of lead metal last year, down 7% from the previous year. The company said it would provide further information in due course but at the latest when it publishes H1 results on July 31.
