Negotiations remain ongoing between West Africa-focussed gold producer Avesoro Resources’ openpit mining contractor, Orkun, and former employees of the company’s openpit operation at its Youga mine, in Burkina Faso. Negotiations are being handled with a view to re-hiring the employees. Avesoro had explained in a release earlier this week that the employees had refused to work after an initiative to transition Youga to contractor mining had resulted in a reduction in operating performance and associated inefficiencies. Avesoro’s CEO is “working closely with senior management of Orkun” to resolve the situation, the TSX- and Aim-listed company said on Wednesday. In the interim, Avesoro said that it remains confident of a positive near-term conclusion but noted that gold processing operations at the mine had been temporarily suspended. Mining and processing operations will recommence upon the successful conclusion of these negotiations.
