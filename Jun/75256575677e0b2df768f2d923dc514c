TSX-V-listed junior explorer Giyani Metals Corporation has completed the solvent extraction phase of its ongoing hydrometallurgical testing programme. The company reported on Friday that the extraction tests had been performed on manganese mineralised material taken from the company’s K.Hill deposit, in Botswana. The final stage of the programme, which entailed electrowinning, was under way and expected to be completed soon. The purpose of the extraction tests were to purify the leached solutions that were obtained from the acid leaching phase for two samples. Purifying the leached solutions from deleterious metal ions resulted in a highly pure manganese solution that is suitable for electrowinning to produce high-purity electrolytic manganese metal (EMM) – a key component used in the production of batteries for the growing electric vehicle market. “We are very pleased with these extraction results as they represent the most technically challenging steps of the overall solvent extraction/electrowinning process. The results bring us one step closer to finalising the hydrometallurgical process route to making our intended end-product, EMM,” said Giyani CEO Robin Birchall. Giyani is developing a manganese project in the Kanye Basin, Botswana.
