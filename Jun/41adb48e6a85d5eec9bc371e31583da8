PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Commissioning has started at the Juardi gold project, in Western Australia, with full production targeted for the fourth quarter of this year. ASX-listed Beacon Minerals on Thursday said that the A$21.4-million project was expected to recover some 126 000 oz of gold over a five-year mine life, generating life-of-mine revenues of around A$208.5-million and surplus operating cash flows of A$98.4-million at a gold price of A$1 650/oz. “The gold price today at circa A$1 955/oz, when compared to the gold price of A$1 650/oz used in the prefeasibility study is very positive for the project and will only increase the company’s success and shareholder value from the Juardi project,” said Beacon MD Graham McGarry. He noted that the ongoing process at Juardi was a testament to the team the company had in place, with the final stages of the precommissioning now being completed. The commissioning activities will involve the testing of the electrical drives, instrumentation and process control systems, with wet commissioning of the plant expected to start in mid-July.
