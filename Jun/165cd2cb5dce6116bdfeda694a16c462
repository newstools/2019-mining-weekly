Australia-based Infinity Lithium said on Wednesday that support for its San Jose project, in Spain, was emerging from multiple levels, including government and businesses endorsements, as well as wider European-level recognition. The Extremadura regional government had informed Infinity that the regional Ministry of Economy and Infrastructure would be at the disposal of the San Jose joint venture to collaborate, clarify and accompany it through the administrative procedure of the permitting process. San Jose has also received public endorsement from various Spanish business associations, as well as the European Battery Association, the European Commission and European Investment Bank. “The critical need for lithium extraction and its conversion into chemicals in Europe is now well understood. As work continues, it has also become clear that the San Jose lithium project is in a unique position to supply the European lithium-ion battery and electric vehicle industries thanks to being a large, long-term and environmentally friendly project,” Infinity stated.
