Canada-headquartered Ivanhoe Mines says construction of the highway linking its Kamoa-Kakula copper project to the Kolwezi airport, in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), is progressing rapidly with the onset of the country’s dry season. The 34-km-long east–west road is about 25% complete and is expected to be fully operational by the end of the year. Once complete, the road will significantly improve Kamoa-Kakula’s transportation corridor that is being used to bring in mining equipment and construction materials, as well as to transport copper concentrates in the near future. The new road will also improve the safety and commuting time for employees between Kamoa-Kakula, Kolwezi and Lubumbashi, as well as for mine visitors arriving at the Kolwezi airport, Ivanhoe notes. Kamoa-Kakula is a joint venture between Ivanhoe with 39.6% ownership and Zijin Mining Group with 39.6% ownership, while Crystal River Global holds a 0.8% stake and the DRC government 20%.
