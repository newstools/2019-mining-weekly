A wildfire that is burning near the westernmost property boundary of the Pinto Valley copper/gold mine has led to owner Capstone Mining curtailing nonessential activities at the mine. The TSX-listed miner said, at the time of sending out its news release at 15:30 EST, that the wildfire had no physical impact on the infrastructure or operations of the mine. “The Pinto Valley team have been focused on ensuring the safety of our people and safely executing work to protect our operations, including increasing defensible space by removing combustible brush and grass, installing sprinklers, covering pipelines with soil, removing propane from site and relocating mobile equipment," said Capstone CEO Darren Pylot,. "We have been working closely with neighbouring private landowners and authorities on regional preparations to ensure the protection of personnel, facilities and infrastructure, as well as the natural environment." The company said that a minimal crew would remain at the mine and that full operations would resume once the safety and security of mine personnel and infrastructure could be assured. Pinto Valley is one of Capstone’s two producing mines, the other being the Cozamin polymetallic mine in Zacatecas state, Mexico.
