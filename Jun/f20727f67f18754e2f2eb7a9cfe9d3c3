PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The Western Australian Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) has green-lit the A$427-million Yangibana rare-earths project, being developed by ASX-listed Hastings Technology Metals. The one-million-tonne-a-year operation is expected to produce some 15 000 t/y of mixed rare earths carbonate, and about 8 850 t/y of total rare earth oxides over ten years. EPA chairperson Dr Tom Hatton said rare-earth elements from this mine could be used for permanent magnets, like those used in electric vehicles and mobile phones. “The EPA’s environmental assessment for this rare earths proposal considered impacts on flora and vegetation, stygofauna, local water systems and human health and also considered if these impacts were manageable. “The EPA has recommended conditions to manage these environmental impacts, including requirements for surveys of significant flora and vegetation, modelling of surface water before any clearing and the preparation of management plans for flora and vegetation and stygofauna fauna.” The proposal includes the development of five openmine pits, groundwater abstraction, on-site processing of ore, tailings storage facilities, access and haul roads and supporting infrastructure such as accommodation facilities, administration buildings and an airstrip. Hatton noted that rare earths had elevated levels of radiation, but that Hastings had demonstrated it could adequately manage these levels within acceptable limits to protect human health and the broader environment. The EPA’s report to the Minister for Environment is now open for a two-week public appeal period, closing July 10.
