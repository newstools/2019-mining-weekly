Aim-listed Galileo Resources has acquired the remaining Kabwe residual rights, including the Kashitu zinc willemite exploration prospect, as well as exercised its right to acquire a further 15% interest in Enviro Zambia from BMR Group for 9.6-million Galileo shares. Enviro Zambia owns 95% of Enviro Processing Zambia, to which Star Zinc's large-scale exploration licence remains to be transferred, subject to Zambian regulatory approval. Completion of this acquisition adds substantially to Galileoâ€™s prospective zinc metal base and increases it beneficial interest to 95% in its advanced Star Zinc project, CEO Colin Bird said in a statement issued on Monday. He added that the Kashitu zinc mineralisation had the added benefit of vanadium, which would add significant value to the overall metals package.
