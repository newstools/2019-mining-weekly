PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Western Australian Premier Mark McGowan has official opened the A$270-million Cataby mineral sands mine, owned by ASX-listed Iluka Resources. Cataby production is expected to average 200 000 t/y of synthetic rutile from 370 000 t/y of ilmenite, 50 000 t/y of zircon and 30 000 t/y of rutile over a 13-year mine life. During construction, the project employed 600 staff, with a further 600 staff required during operation over three sites, including the processing facility in Capel. “I commend Iluka on the opening of the Cataby operation and for continuing to be a significant creator of jobs in Western Australia's Mid-West and South-West regions,” McGowan said. “These mining and processing jobs provide opportunities for regional workers and their families, and will support the local economies of Dandaragan, Capel and Geraldton over many years. “In Iluka's case, downstream processing sees the value of these products captured here in Western Australia, creating more employment opportunities for Western Australians. “This project is another sign of confidence returning to Western Australia's economy, and I look forward to seeing the community benefit from Iluka's investment.”
