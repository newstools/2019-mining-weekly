PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Construction of the much-maligned Carmichael coal project, in Queensland, has started. Indian major Adani on Thursday said that some 60 workers were currently on site for surveying and clearing purposes to allow access onto the mine site, while also working on geotechnical and water management activities. “Construction on the Carmichael project formally commenced following the receipt of the final environmental management approval from the Queensland government. “Ramp up and construction on the Carmichael mine and rail project will take approximately two years now that all relevant approvals have been received,” a spokesperson for the company told Mining Weekly Online. “Works will continue to ramp up over the coming weeks and months. The Carmichael project will see 1 500 direct jobs and 6 750 indirect jobs created at the peak points of ramp-up and construction. “We remain committed to Townsville and Rockhampton as the primary hubs of employment for the Carmichael project, with regions such as the Whitsunday, Isaac, Central Highlands, Mackay, Charters Towers and Gladstone regions also benefiting from work packages and employment opportunities for our project,” the spokesperson said. The Minerals Council of Australia (MCA) has welcomed the start of construction, with CEO Tania Constable saying the construction of the mine and infrastructure project is tremendous and long-overdue news for Queensland jobs and regional communities. “The Carmichael mine will allow thousands of Queenslanders to get highly paid, highly skilled jobs close to where they live, which is a big win for central Queensland and Australia,” Constable said. The start of construction followed eight years of planning and assessment at both state and commonwealth level, with the Queensland Premier stepping in last month to instruct the Coordinator-General to ensure the completion of the assessment and approvals process.
