PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Iron-ore miner Atlas Iron has moved on the development of its Corunna Downs iron-ore project, in the Pilbara, submitting a project proposal to the state’s Environmental Protection Authority. The proposal covers the development of five openpit operations producing 23.3-million tonnes of iron-ore over a six-year period, at an average rate of around four-million tonnes a year. Atlas Iron is expected to clear more than 423.1 ha of native vegetation within the 2 257 ha tenement. A 2016 prefeasibility study estimated that the project would require a capital investment of between A$47-million and A$53-million, and would have C1 cash costs of between A$37/t and A$43/t. Atlas was acquired by a subsidiary of Hancock Prospecting at the tail end of 2018, with the company ceasing share trading on the ASX in November.
