TSX-listed Western Resources subsidiary Western Potash has entered into a lump-sum agreement with Stuart Olson Praire Construction for it to be the general contractor for the Phase 1 construction of the company’s Milestone project, in Saskatchewan. The Milestone Phase 1 potash project would be the “newest, most environment friendly and capital efficient” new potash mine in Canada, according to a statement published by Western Resources on Friday. “By using advanced drilling techniques, the project will be able to initially target the high-grade potash bed, then by using selective dissolution, preferentially leach the potash to the surface. “This means that salt will be left underground and there will be no tailings pile at the surface, thereby reducing water consumption,” Western Resources explained. The potash is then crystallised naturally in a pond, owing to the temperature change, resulting in much lower energy consumption and a capital cost, compared with other solution mines. Western Potash had already completed the early work to prepare the site, including an access road, site clearing and piling foundations, water well, water pipeline and power infrastructure. The civil work of the crystallisation pond had also been completed. Stuart Olson’s general contractor scope of work would include the construction of all above-ground facilities, including concrete, steel and pipe works, installation of equipment, electrical and control system work, building work and site finishing. Stuart Olson is anticipated to mobilise to the project site before the end of this month, with a projected maximum workforce of about 100 people on site. Western Potash expected production from the Milestone project in mid-2020.
