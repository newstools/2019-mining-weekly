ASX-listed Mincor has decided to cease mining operations at Widgiemooltha Gold Operations (WGO) from August 1. This follows a strategic review of the company’s gold operations in Western Australia, which was announced in March. Mincor stated on Friday that the strategic review was consistent with the company’s core focus on restarting nickel sulphide production in the Kambalda district. Further, the company’s toll treatment agreement with Westgold, at its Higginsville operations, would expire on June 30, with the ownership of Higginsville scheduled to transfer to RNC Minerals during the month. Meanwhile, to treat remaining ore from Higginsville, Mincor has agreed terms to start a new short-term tolling agreement at the Lakewood processing facility, in Kalgoorlie, which should see Mincor treating two parcels of ore during August and September, which will total between 80 000 t and 90 000 t. The final aspect of the strategic review entails starting a divestment process of WGO, together with its gold rights at Bluebush and Jeffreys Find.
