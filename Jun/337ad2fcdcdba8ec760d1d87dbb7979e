Moya Greene has resigned from the board of diversified miner Rio Tinto with immediate effect, owing to time constraints. The Canadian national, who previously headed Britainâ€™s Royal Mail, said in a statement announcing her resignation on Wednesday that the time commitment to serve on the Rio Tinto board had proven more considerable than she had expected. Greene served on the Rio Tinto board for less than a year, having joined as a nonexecutive director in September 2018, when then-chairperson Jan du Plessis said that her appointment ensured the board maintained a strong Canadian voice. The company did not announce a new director on Wednesday.
