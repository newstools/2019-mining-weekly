Dual-listed DRDGold on Wednesday announced that Malaysian exploration company OroTree had elected not to exercise an option to acquire the mining infrastructure assets to access the deep underground ounces of East Rand Proprietary Mines (ERPM). OroTree had, in February, acquired the mining rights and prospecting right of ERPM and had until June 30 to exercise the option to acquire the infrastructure assets. DRDGold will, therefore, not receive the $10.3-million, less a nonrefundable fee of $500 000, as purchase consideration for the infrastructure assets.
