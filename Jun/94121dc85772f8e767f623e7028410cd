SANTIAGO â€“ Chile's Codelco, the world's top copper miner, told Reuters on Friday that its Chuquicamata copper mine was once again fully operational following a two-week long strike that had docked output from the sprawling deposit. The three largest labor unions at the mine voted last night to accept the latest labor contract offer from Codelco, officially ending the walk-off.
