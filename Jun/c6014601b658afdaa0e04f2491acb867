PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Gold miner Resolute Mining has achieved commercial production at its Syama underground mine, in Mali. Ore production from the underground mine has achieved more than 80% of nameplate capacity, with the mine producing more than 38 500 t of ore over the last week. This level of production will be sustained on a quarterly basis, says Resolute MD and CEO John Welborn. “The Syama underground mine will transform Resolute. Achievement of sustained rates of commercial production from the world’s first fully automated underground gold mine is a key milestone for Syama, for Resolute and for the mining industry.” At full capacity, the underground operation is expected to produce some 46 000 t/w of ore, and 2.4-million tonnes a year, using a fully-integrated mining fleet. Welborn notes that all aspects of the mine are now operational, with daily ore haulage rates regularly reaching above 5 000 t/d. “We are now focused on continuing the successful production ramp-up to nameplate capacity and the completion of full automation of all aspects of the sublevel cave during 2019,” he adds. Full commissioning of the underground operation has been targeted for the third quarter of this year.
