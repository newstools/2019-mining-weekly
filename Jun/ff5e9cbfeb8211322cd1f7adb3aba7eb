The Pinto Valley copper mine, 125 km from Phoenix, Arizona, has been safety restarted, following last week’s fire that led to a curtailment of operations. The mine site did not sustain any physical damage during the Woodbury fire, which by Sunday morning had ballooned to more than 96 000 acres and was of “serious concern”, TSX-listed Capstone Mining said on Monday. “We remain in close contact with Southwest Area incident management team to stay informed and connected to any changes in firefighting strategy. "We are very appreciative of the efforts of all the emergency responders who have been battling the Woodbury fire and for the coordination between SAIMT and our team at Pinto Valley, which now allows for the safe restart of operations," said president and CEO Darren Pylot. The curtailment of operations should not impact on Pinto Valley’s operating or cost guidance, the company stated. The Pinto Valley guidance for 2019 is to produce 115-million to 125-million pounds of copper at a C1 cash cost of $2.10/lb to $2.25/lb.
