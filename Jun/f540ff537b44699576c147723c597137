LUSAKA â€“ A Zambian court on Friday withdrew an earlier order blocking a provisional liquidator at Vedanta's Konkola Copper Mines (KCM) business from disposing of KCM's assets or making arrangements with its creditors. The about-turn from the Zambian High Court is the latest twist in a dispute between Vedanta and the Zambian government, which says KCM breached its operating licence. Vedanta has denied that claim, and has said it will protect its assets in Zambia, a major African copper producer. The case has intensified concerns among international miners about resource nationalism in Africa. "It is hereby ordered that the ex-parte order to stay some of the powers of the provisional liquidator dated June 26, 2019, be and is hereby vacated forthwith," the Zambian High Court said in a ruling seen by Reuters. The ruling did not give a reason for the withdrawal of the order. State-owned Zambian radio reported that lawyers for Zambia's mining investment arm, which owns a minority stake in KCM, had argued in court that the earlier order was irregular. Reuters has approached Vedanta for comment.
