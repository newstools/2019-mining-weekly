Canada-headquartered Kirkland Lake has partnered technology firm VRIFY to establish a gold deal room, which will help the company attract, assess and refine investment opportunities. Announcing the launch of the VRIFY-developed platform on Monday, the miner’s president and CEO, Tony Makuch, said that the deal room should help the company learn more about the “many worthwhile opportunities out there”. Kirkland Lake will be interested in gold projects including projects with by-products, in Australia, Canada or other parts of North America, as well as Europe, New Zealand and South America. The company is prepared to evaluate investment into, or acquisition of, value accretive assets at any stage development. Kirkland Lake and VRIFY said that companies with assets that required capital, and met the criteria, could make online submissions to the KL gold deal room at vrify.com/klgolddealroom. “It may be a tough market for commodities but there is no shortage of compelling opportunities out there waiting to be discovered. By leveraging accessible technology, we're making it possible for growth-focused companies like Kirkland Lake Gold to attract, assess and refine large numbers of investment opportunities," commented VRIFY founder, president and CEO Stephen de Jong. Kirkland Lake currently operates mines in Canada and Australia.
