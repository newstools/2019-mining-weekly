Australia-based Lucapa Diamond Company has launched a $3.3.-million, 12-month exploration programme to locate the kimberlite source of the high-value alluvial diamonds that it currently mines at the Lulo mine, in Angola. The programme is based on a technical review of Lulo kimberlite exploration results to date, including those of the 2018 drilling programme, which confirmed a further 70 kimberlites within the Lulo alluvial diamond field, which increased the total known kimberlites in the concession to more than 100.
  
“The next phase of the kimberlite programme builds on the great body of exploration work completed over many years at Lulo to pin-point the source pipes hosting the world’s best alluvial diamonds,” said MD Stephen Wetherall. “Like the diamond experts involved in our recent technical review, we remain convinced that the kimberlite source of these diamonds awaits discovery beneath our prolific alluvial diamond field.” Lulo is the world’s highest-value alluvial diamond field, producing diamond sales of $146-million to date at an average price of $2 000/ct. Lulo has produced 13 alluvial diamonds of more than 100 ct, including Angola’s two biggest recorded diamonds weighing 404 ct and 227 ct.
