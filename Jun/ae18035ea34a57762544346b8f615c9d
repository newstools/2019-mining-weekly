LONDON – Nyrstar has halted production at its Port Pirie lead smelter in Australia and declared force majeure, the Belgian-headquartered metals and mining company said on Thursday. It stopped output at Port Pirie on May 28 due to an unplanned outage at the blast furnace, a spokesman said in an email. "We are currently in the process of assessing the outage and expect that production should resume within the coming days. There will be a negative impact to Nyrstar’s lead metal production due to the outage," he added. Port Pirie produced 160 000 t of lead metal last year, down 7% from the previous year.
