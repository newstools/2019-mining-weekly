Aim-listed tin, gold and tungsten miner W Resources has appointed General de Maquinaria y Excavaci√≥n (GME) its mining contractor for the La Parilla tungsten project, in Spain. The La Parrilla mining fleet was in place, said W in a statement on Friday, with three 60-tonne haul trucks, a Liebherr excavator and other auxiliary equipment on site, which would be gradually scaled-up in response to the demand as ramp-up progresses. W chairperson Michael Masterman said project construction completion for La Parilla remained on track, with the concentrator plant completion due in June, and commissioning due by July. He added that some smaller modular plant equipment was being delivered and would be installed by early July.
