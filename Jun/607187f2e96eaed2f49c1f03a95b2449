Northern Ireland-focused gold mine developer Galantas Gold has appointed Róisín Magee its nonexecutive board member, following the recent passing of Jack Gunter. Gunter passed away earlier this month. Magee has been a nonexecutive director of Galantas since October last year and has 32 years’ experience in the corporate finance and investment industry. “Róisín’s strong record within the investment industry has given her the key skills necessary for the chairperson position and I am delighted that she agreed to accept the position,” president and CEO Roland Phelps commented on Friday. Galantas also announced that mining engineer David Cather had been elected as a nonexecutive director of the company. He has more than 30 years of mining experience and has held CEO roles in Avocet Mining, the Abu Dhabi Capital Group Mining Division and was COO for European Goldfields. Commenting on Cather’s appointment to the board, Phelps said that his mining experience would be of great value to the company as it moved forward development of the Omagh gold mine.
