Jack Gunter, the nonexecutive chairperson of Toronto- and London-listed Galantas Gold has died. The company said on Wednesday that Gunter had led the discovery of the Omagh gold deposits in Northern Ireland, which were currently in development. “Although not actively engaged in management for many years his contribution to the company over the years, in addition to his guidance and support as a director and chairman, was much appreciated by his colleagues,” a Galantas statement read. A new chairperson would be appointed in due course.
