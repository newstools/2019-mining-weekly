President Cyril Ramaphosa will announce more measures to support cash-strapped power utility Eskom, his office said on Tuesday, without providing details. "It is expected that the President will announce further measures to support Eskom's efforts at recovery and financial and operational sustainability," the Presidency said in a statement, following a meeting between Ramaphosa and Eskom's board. The Presidency did not say when the measures would be announced, but Ramaphosa is scheduled to make his State of the Nation address on Thursday.
