The Voro plant has become the second gold production operation of Russian miner Polymetal to be certified as being in full compliance with the international cyanide management code. The International Cyanide Management Institute (ICMI) certified Voro as compliant for a gold mining company and separately as a cyanide transporter. Polymetal became a signatory to the cyanide code as a mining company in 2016 and as a cyanide transporter in 2018. Last month, Polymetalâ€™s Amursk POX plant became the second gold production operation in Russia and the former Soviet Union, which has been certified by the ICMI. The cyanide code is a voluntary industry programme for companies involved in the production of gold and/or silver using cyanide and companies producing and transporting this cyanide. The code is intended to complement an operation's existing obligation to comply with the applicable laws and regulations of the political jurisdictions in which the operation is located.
