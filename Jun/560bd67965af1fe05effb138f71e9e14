Aim-listed BlueRock Diamonds, the owner and operator of the Kareevlei diamond mine, in Kimberley, has sold a 24.98 ct diamond recovered earlier this month for $190 000. Executive chairperson Mike Houston on Friday commented that the company was delighted with the sale of its largest diamond to date, adding that its recovery and sale demonstrated the potential of Kareevlei. “We continue to make excellent progress implementing our development strategy to increase production and are clearly seeing the impact of higher throughput being achieved, reflected in the number of high-value stones we continue to produce,” he noted.
