Metallurgical testing results of stockpile material from TSX-listed Giyani Metals’ K.Hill and Otse manganese deposits, in Botswana, indicate that a variety of lumpy and fine particle manganese products are possible, the company said on Friday. As an example, Giyani noted that a 36% manganese lumpy product could be produced from the K.Hill stockpiles with a dense media separation yield of 39% using standard crushing, screening and densimetric separation. The company will decide on the most suitable product on which to focus based on tradeoff studies between cost and potential revenue at prevailing market rates. “We are extremely pleased with these metallurgical results. Simply put, they indicate that we will be able to generate a range of potential products from the stockpile material at suitable grade and yield recoveries. “These products will all be marketable into the manganese steel market,” CEO Robin Birchall commented. He added that the company would be working closely with its lender Traxys Africa Trading to determine which products would have the highest economic returns for Giyani.
