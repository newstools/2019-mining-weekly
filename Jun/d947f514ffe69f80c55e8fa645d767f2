The controversial Gupta-owned Shiva Uranium mine has been put up for auction by its business rescue practitioners. Shiva was placed under business rescue in February 2018, along with eight other Gupta-affiliated businesses. The assets on offer at the mine in Hartbeesfontein, North West, include the gold and uranium resource; a pressure acid leach uranium plant; a carbon-in-leach gold processing plant; a crushing and screening circuit; a smelt house; mine infrastructure such as shafts, electrical and water reticulation, roads infrastructure, dams and dumps; properties; and mining rights and licences. Interested parties need to submit vetting documents, pay a deposit and complete a nondisclosure agreement before being granted access to the data room to complete due diligence. Due diligence needs to be finalised by July 26. The deadline for bids to be submitted to GoIndustry DoveBid South Africa is August 2.
