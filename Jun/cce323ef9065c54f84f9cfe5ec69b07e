PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The Western Australian Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) has recommended environmental approval for iron-ore major Fortescue’s Eliwana iron-ore mine, in the Pilbara. The Fortescue board in May last year approved the $1.27-billion Eliwana mine and rail project, which will entail a new 30-million-tonne-a-year dry ore processing facility and infrastructure and a 143-km rail line. Production is expected to start in December 2020, and the mine will introduce a 60% iron-grade product into Fortescue’s portfolio by the second half of the 2019 financial year. EPA chairperson Dr Tom Hatton on Monday said that the development of Eliwana had been approved subject to conditions, including minimising impacts on surface and groundwater, flora and vegetation and places of Aboriginal cultural significance. “The EPA has recommended a range of conditions on the Eliwana iron-ore mine project to manage impacts to local flora, fauna, surface water, groundwater and Aboriginal heritage,” Hatton said. “Our environmental impact assessment found there would be a significant impact from the clearing of 7 900 ha of vegetation as part of the proposal, which is habitat for the northern quoll, ghost bat and Pilbara olive python. “The EPA has recommended the proponent offset this impact through a contribution to the Pilbara Environmental Offsets Fund and it has also recommended the creation of management plans to minimise impacts to surface water, groundwater, flora and vegetation and native animals.” The EPA’s decision is now open for a two-week public appeals period, closing on July 8, with the Minister of Environment expected to make the final decision.
