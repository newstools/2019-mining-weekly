Listed gold developer Galantas Gold has accelerated mine development at its Omagh mine, in Northern Ireland, with good progress on the main decline tunnel and increased concentrate production. The company reported on Tuesday that the main decline tunnel had reached the fourth (1 060 m) level and that an access drive to intersect the Kearney vein on this level had started. The vein should be intersected in about four weeks’ time. Increased in-vein development was expected to drive further increases in feed tonnage to the processing plant, which produces a concentrate sold under an offtake contract. A second shift was added to the processing plant operations early in the second quarter and Galantas said that an expansion to three shifts was planned for the third quarter, once vein development on the fourth level was confirmed. Concentrate sales revenues with a provisional value of about $460 000 were expected for the second quarter, representing expected quarter shipments of about 160 t of concentrate.
