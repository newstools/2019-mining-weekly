Aim-listed and Africa-focussed minerals exploration company IronRidge Resources on Thursday announced that it had completed due diligence over the Zaranou gold project, in Côte d'Ivoire, and that its joint venture agreement with GeoServices Côte d'Ivoire and Atlas Resources was now unconditional. The company has secured access rights to the highly prospective Zaranou gold licence, covering 397 km2 of highly prospective Birimian geology. IronRidge has secured high-resolution satellite imagery over the licence area, which has successfully defined 40 km strike of artisanal mining sites and helped define high-priority target areas, said IronRidge CEO and MD Vincent Mascolo. Introductory meetings have been held with government officials and community leaders within the licence area, enabling field work to start. “We are very pleased with GeoServices’ professionalism and corporate social responsibility programmes introducing IronRidge to the local communities and government officials, as well as successfully getting the licence application granted,” commented Mascolo. IronRidge is now actively carrying out initial field programmes, including mapping, channel sampling and trenching over the highest priority target areas defined from the satellite imagery ahead of drill testing.
