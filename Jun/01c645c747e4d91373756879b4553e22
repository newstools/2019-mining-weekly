Aim- and FSE-listed Bluejay Mining has reached an important step in the permitting process for the Dundas project with the submission of its prefeasibility study (PFS) to the Mineral Licence and Safety Authority (MLSA) of Greenland. The lodgement of the PFS marks the completion of the final module necessary to facility an exploitation application, Bluejay CEO Roderick McIllree said in a statement on Thursday. The completion of the study allows the Greenlandic authorities to understand the proposed development, including site layout and mining technique, as well as the economic consequences that come from exploitation of the ilmenite-bearing sand within the licence area. The submitted PFS, which includes the mineral reserve and mine plan, focuses on the onshore mining opportunity, the anticipated processing and associated infrastructure. The study has been completed based on a yearly production of 440 000 t of ilmenite concentrate from the project. “The conclusions drawn from this study indicate positive economic outcomes and low environmental impact, with strong social benefits,” said McIllree, adding that the market would be updated with details of the PFS in “due course”.
