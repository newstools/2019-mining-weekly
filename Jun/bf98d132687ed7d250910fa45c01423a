Aim-listed Arc Minerals has started an initial 7Â 500 m drilling programme at its Zamsort/Zaco copper project, in the Zambian Copperbelt. The drilling programme is designed to test the large Cheyeza anomaly, as well as the Lumbeta and Muswema targets, in addition to other targets generated through the comprehensive geophysical and soil sampling programme. The company has appointed a local drilling contractor with significant experience in the copperbelt and two diamond drill rigs have started drilling. Arc has, over the past year, completed a detailed geophysical survey and extensive soil sampling programme, which has yielded some excellent results, indicating that there may be a number of high-potential prospects within the Zamsort licence, executive chairperson Nick von Schirnding says. The company has also generated a large number of drilling targets from the data and geological models, beginning with Cheyeza, one of its highest-priority targets.
