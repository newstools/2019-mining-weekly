PERTH (miningweekly.com) â€“ Oil and gas major Woodside on Tuesday downgraded its full year production guidance for 2019 towards the lower end of between 88-million and 94-million barrels of oil equivalent. The decision followed an extension of its Pluto liquefied natural gas turnaround, with restart of production now targeted for the end of June. Woodside on Tuesday said that the turnaround was completed as planned, however, the mixed refrigerator compressor experienced vibrations on restart. As a result, further activities extending the turnaround have commenced to restart production. The company said that it has made arrangements to meet its supply obligations, including the purchase of third-party cargoes.
