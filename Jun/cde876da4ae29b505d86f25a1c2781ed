PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The Western Australian government is investigating the potential for a renewable hydrogen industry in Western Australia, and the opportunities it could present to the mining sector. Minister assisting the Minister for State Development, Jobs and Trade, Alannah MacTiernan, said this week that hydrogen had massive applications in the mining sector including fuel substitution, renewables integration and power supply, and the commercialisation of renewable hydrogen technologies. “Western Australia has an opportunity to lead the hydrogen transformation race. Renewable hydrogen can cut mining's reliance on costly diesel imports, whilst developing a new, sustainable industry. "The generation of power through locally produced hydrogen will open up great opportunities in regional Western Australia,” she noted. MacTiernan said that some of Western Australia’s key trading partners, including Japan, Singapore and South Korea, are signalling their intentions to import low emission hydrogen to help transition away from fossil fuels and increase energy security. “Western Australia is well positioned to take advantage of this potential multibillion-dollar industry, and the race is on with other countries positioning themselves to become major exporters of renewable hydrogen.” The Western Australian government in September last year established the Western Australian Renewable Hydrogen Council, which has since identified four strategic focus areas to achieve a long-term vision of a renewable hydrogen market in Western Australia for export and domestic purposes.
