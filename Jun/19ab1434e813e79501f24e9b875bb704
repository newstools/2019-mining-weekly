Aim-listed BlueRock Diamonds has recovered its largest diamond to date, a 24.98 ct gem-quality diamond. This diamond, which was recovered from its Kareevlei diamond mine, near Kimberley, in South Africa’s Northern Cape, would shortly be put to tender. The largest diamond recovered prior to this weighed 16.28 ct and sold for $78 947. “Th[e] recovery of such a high-quality diamond is an exciting milestone and underpins why we are so confident about the potential of the Kareevlei mine,” BlueRock executive chairperson Mike Houston said in a statement on Friday. He added that the company had developed a comprehensive development plan to increase production at the mine.
