Platinum miner Lonmin, which is being bought out by Sibanye-Stillwater, on Friday announced that a court had sanctioned the scheme by which the recommended offer by Sibanye for the entire issued and to be issued ordinary share capital of Lonmin was being implemented. The scheme would become effective upon a copy of the court order being delivered to the Registrar of Companies, which was expected to occur on Friday evening. Lonminâ€™s shares on the LSE and JSE would be suspended as from June 10.
