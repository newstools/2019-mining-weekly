PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Myanmar Metals has reported a 50% increase in the indicated resource estimate for its Bawdwin polymetallic mine, in Myanmar, which is now estimated to host the world’s largest primary lead resource. The indicated mineral resource has now been estimated at 37.2-million tonnes, at 4.3% lead, 114 g/t silver, 2.4% zinc and 0.2% copper, an increase of 12.4-million tonnes on the previous estimate. The global indicated and inferred resource for the Bawdwin project now stands at an estimated 94.2-million tonnes, at 4.2% lead, 107 g/t silver, 2.1% zinc and 0.2% copper. “Bawdwin continues to grow, not only in resource tonnes but in stature as a globally significant source of silver and base metals for the remainder of this century,” said Myanmar CEO and chairperson John Lamb. “The late 2018 drilling campaign that underpins this update was confined to the area of the planned China pit. It aimed to improve our understanding and tighten up our resource modeling parameters, and to increase drill density and confidence in the vicinity of the pit.” Lamb said that the increased resource confidence would allow the company to focus on the engineering, process design, cost estimation, operational planning and all related functions for a prefeasibility study.
