PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Bellevue Gold has reported a 47% increase in the inferred resource estimate at its Bellevue gold project, in Western Australia. Following recent drilling targeting the Bellevue Surrounds mineralisation, the company was now estimating an inferred mineral resource of 1.53-million ounces, grading 11.8 g/t gold. “The latest upgrade once again confirms the exceptional quality of the Bellevue gold project, which is globally one of the highest grade and fastest growing gold projects, and we are confident further drilling will continue to rapidly advance the resource base in 2019,” said Bellevue MD Steve Parsons. “This Bellevue Surrounds resource estimate is important for the project as it is located within metres of the historic underground mine development. The company has now turned its attention to delineating further resource ounces from step-out drilling with the four drill rigs at the very high grade Viago Lode and Western Corridor.”
