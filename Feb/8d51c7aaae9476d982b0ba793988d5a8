South Africa will in the coming days unveil a package of measures to shore up State-owned Eskom's finances and address structural issues facing the struggling power firm, President Cyril Ramaphosa said on Tuesday. "In the coming few days we will be announcing a package of measures to stabilise as well as to improve Eskom's financial, operational as well as structural position, and to ensure security of energy supply for the economy," Ramaphosa told a mining conference in Cape Town. "We will not allow Eskom to fail," he added. Ramaphosa is trying to turn around the ailing company - which supplies more than 90% of South Africa's power but is drowning in R420-billion of debt.
