Field activities are gaining momentum in Côte d’Ivoire, West Africa, for Aim-listed IronRidge Resources’ portfolio of projects, as the country enters its dry season for 2019. Commenting on the company’s latest progress, IronRidge COO Len Kolff noted in a statement on Monday that airborne magnetics have been completed over the Vavoua portfolio, with the shear zone extensions along strike from the 700 000 oz Abujar project “clearly evident”. This, he added, provides structural targets for the company, as well as confidence for ongoing exploration. Preliminary soil samples have identified mineralised trends at Marahui. Infill soil sampling is under way to confirm trends ahead of potential trenching.
