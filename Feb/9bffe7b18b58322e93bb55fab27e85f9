PERTH (miningweekly.com) â€“ Base metals miner MMG on Monday warned that it would delay some shipments from its Las Bambas copper mine, in Peru, owing to a community blockade. The illegal blockade occurs on a stretch of public national roads, the ASX-listed company told shareholders. The blockade related to claims for compensation for a pre-existing easement that overlaps a public road on the Yavi Yavi farmland, which was transferred to the community of Fuerabamba as part of the 2011 resettlement agreement for Las Bambas. The company told shareholders that it was committed to transparent and productive dialogue and supported the development of the resettled community. The blockade has not had an impact on production as yet, but MMG noted that with low copper concentrate stocks at the Matarani port, the company would need to delay some shipments. Las Bambas produced 111 865 t of copper in concentrate during the December quarter on the back of higher mining and record milling rates as well as higher ore grades, a 29% increase on the September quarter.
