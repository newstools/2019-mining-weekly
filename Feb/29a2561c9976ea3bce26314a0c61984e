Canadian junior Far Resources has discovered five new pegmatite dykes at its Zoro lithium project, near Snow Lake, in Manitoba. This brings the total number of mineralised pegmatites discovered so far at Zoro to 13, covering at least a third of the 3 005 ha property. Each of the five new dykes are spodumene- and tantalite-bearing, similar to the eight dykes already known on the property. Far said on Monday that these new discoveries highlighted the potential for a major pegmatite field existing below the till cover, while expanding the pegmatite field about 3 km to the north. Further, a new discovery to the south of the Dyke 1 resource, where 1.1-million tonnes of lithium oxide grading 0.91% has been delineated so far, shows potential for significant expansion to the south, where no exploration has yet taken place. “The scalability is now unquestionable, with at least a third of the property now known to host mineralised dykes. Meanwhile, the property to the west and south of Dyke 1 remains entirely unexplored. Both areas offer huge potential for the discovery of additional pegmatite dykes,” said president and CEO Toby Mayo. A total of 3 054 m of drilling were completed in 22 holes during the latest exploration campaign, including holes drilled for metallurgy. In total, the five campaigns amount to 8 406 m in 60 holes. Of these, three holes were drilled to complete metallurgical testwork on the Dyke 1 pegmatite.
