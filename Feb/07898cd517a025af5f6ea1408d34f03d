News of high-grade gold intersects at the Aamurusko prospect, in northern Finland, sent Canadian explorer Aurion Resources’ share price up 27% on Tuesday. The TSX-V-listed explorer announced that it had intersected 42.28 g/t gold over 4 m in drill hole 82 and 24.50 g/t gold over 4.75 m about 56 m to the east in drill hole 82. Aurion said that the high-grade mineralisation intersected in the drill campaign expanded the known mineralisation in an area that was now estimated to be 56 m wide in an east-west orientation with sub-vertical distance of 110 m. “Successful targeting and discovery of high-grade near-surface gold mineralisation over a strike of 56 m by a depth of 110 m is very encouraging. With short 20 m to 25 m step outs, we may be defining a coherent zone of mineralisation. Drilling has been focused over a distance of 250 m at the eastern extent of the 1.2-km-wide high-grade Aamurusko boulder field.  Results to date suggest potential for additional similar zones of gold mineralisation along strike to the east and west. Gold mineralisation intersected in a 500 m step out to the west supports this premise,” commented Aurion president and CEO Mike Basha. Shares in Aurion gained 27.55% to C$1.25 a share on Tuesday.
