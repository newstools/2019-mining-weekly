Aim-listed Firestone Diamond has recovered a 70 ct white, makeable diamond from its Liqhobong mine, in Lesotho. CEO Paul Bosma said on Tuesday that the 70 ct stone was recovered in the northern, low grade part of the pit where the bulk of Firestone’s mining would take place in the coming months. “Although the market for the smaller stones has been under pressure, we’ve seen continued demand and good prices realised for special stones,” he noted. The diamond will go on sale at the next tender, which is scheduled to take place next month. A 46 ct gem that was recovered in December, sold for more than $1-million at a recent sale.
