The Mexican Federal Economic Competition Commission on Friday approved the proposed transaction whereby Pan American Silver will acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of dual-listed Tahoe Resources. In a statement, Tahoe confirmed that all required regulatory, shareholder and court approvals had been received and that the  arrangement would be completed on or about February 22. The $1.07-billion transaction acquisition of Tahoe effectively doubled Pan American’s silver reserves.
