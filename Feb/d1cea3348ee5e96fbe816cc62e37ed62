The Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU) has called on its members at Sibanye-Stillwater’s platinum operations to again embark on a strike in support of those AMCU members who have been on strike at the miner’s gold operations since November 2018. It has further encouraged its members who are employed at other mines across the country where the union represents the majority, to also join the strike. In addition, it was seeking support from Sibanye investors, calling on them to disinvest from Sibanye. This comes on the back of an announcement by Sibanye last week that it was seeking to cut up to 6 000 jobs as part of the restructuring of its gold operations. Addressing a press briefing, in Johannesburg, on Tuesday, AMCU president Joseph Mathunjwa said the union would be galvanising members at mining companies where it holds the majority, such as Anglo American and Lonmin, to join in the strike. Moreover, members employed at Impala Platinum have already given a clear mandate of support, he noted. “We are going to put this mining sector at a standstill. [Sibanye CEO Neal] Froneman cannot define our future, he cannot define our destinies,” said Mathunjwa. He did not detail when the secondary strike would start.
