CAPE TOWN (miningweekly.com) – Mutually beneficial partnerships are at the heart of the Investing in African Mining Indaba, in Cape Town, this year, which has grown from a conference attended by a few hundred attendees to around 4 000 in its twenty-fifth anniversary year this year. “The mining industry is in a position to make a special contribution to the transformation of our society. This should be a central objective in improving the quality of life of all citizens,” Mining Indaba Advisory Board chairperson Mpho Makwana Makwana told the opening plenary. Integration is a key theme at this year’s Investing in African Mining Indaba, with mining companies urged to contribute to society. Delegates were also looking how the Fourth Industrial Revolution is able to mutually benefit mining companies and social licence stakeholders. Diversity and inclusivity had become key concerns within the mining industry, particularly concerns about the inclusion of women on the boards of mining companies. This is a key theme of the event, as is the issue of mine safety and achieving zero harm in the industry. “We need to ensure that we have no harm in communities in which we trade and operate,” said Makwana. New growth and opportunities through minerals was an exciting path forward, particularly minerals for the digital economy, including smartphones and tablets. Makwana said the Investing in African Mining Indaba was expected to flourish in the years ahead. “Mining is the bedrock of Africa’s industrial development.  The Investing in African Mining Indaba promises to become a mega-event over the next 50 years, with benefits to the local economy of Cape Town, the Western Cape, South Africa and the continent.”
