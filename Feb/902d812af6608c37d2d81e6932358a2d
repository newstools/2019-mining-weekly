NYSE- and TSX-listed Lithium Americas says construction of its Cauchari-Olaroz lithium project, in Argentina, remains on track to reach production in 2020, despite unusually heavy rainfall during recent weeks. Cauchari is wholly-owned by Minera Exar, which is a joint venture company that is in turn owned 62.5% by Lithium Americas and 37.5% owned by Jiangxi Ganfeng. “Although January and February are considered the rainy season in the Jujuy province, there has been minimal disruptions to the current construction activities. “The company has now completed two evaporation ponds, with the first pond currently being filled with brine from the production wells. There are another four ponds under construction,” noted COO Jon Evans. He added that pond construction at the site is on schedule to complete all evaporation ponds covering 12 km2 during the first quarter of next year. Liner supply and liner installation contracts for the remaining ponds have been awarded. Further, the site has seven wells in production and three more under construction. By the end of April, the project is scheduled to have seven drilling rigs mobilised at site for drilling of additional production wells. Contracts have been awarded for earthworks, concrete supply and other key items, and road and platforms construction have been ongoing. Minera Exar is reviewing proposals for long lead items and expects to finalise the awards in due course. The 25 000 t/y battery grade lithium carbonate project will operate for 40 years. Meanwhile, a pilot plant at Lihtium Americas’ wholly-owned Thacker Pass lithium project, in the US state of Nevada, is being commissioned, with testing and optimisation expected to start soon. This follows the release of a preliminary feasibility study of the project in August last year.
