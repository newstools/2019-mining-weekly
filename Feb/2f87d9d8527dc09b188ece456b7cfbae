PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Copper/gold explorer West African Resources on Monday told shareholders that it has applied for a voluntary delisting of its shares from the TSX-V. The company’s shares were expected to cease trading on the Canadian bourse on March 8. The gold developer said that the decision to delist resulted from a number of factors, including limited trading of the company’s shares on the TSX-V over a sustained period of time. Over the last 12 months, some 85% of the company’s share trading occurred on the ASX, with the average daily volumes of shares traded on the ASX reaching 500 000 over the last six months, compared with the 90 000 on the TSX-V. In addition, West African noted that only around 9.5% of the company’s shares were held on the Canadian share register. Canadian shareholders could now move their shareholding in the company to the Australian share register, with the Canadian share register to close after April 30.
