The Canadian Competition Bureau has cleared gold miner Newmontâ€™s $10-billion stock-for-stock acquisition of NYSE- and TSX-listed Goldcorp. The US miner said on Monday that it was continuing to work with other regulatory agencies to secure the additional approvals that were required for the transaction, which was announced in January. The companies aim to close the deal in the second quarter. Following the closure, the combined business would target six- to seven-million ounces of steady-state gold production over a decades-long time horizon, it would have the largest gold reserves and resources in the gold sector, including on a per share basis, and be located in prolific gold districts on four continents.
