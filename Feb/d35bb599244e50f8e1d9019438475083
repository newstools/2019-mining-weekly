Detour Gold has initiated a formal search for a new CFO, following the resignation of James Mayor, who will be leaving the company on April 15. Announcing the resignation, chairperson James Gowans said on Wednesday that Mayor’s departure was an opportunity to renew the leadership at Detour, which is also searching for a permanent CEO. Following a proxy battle with shareholder Paulson & Co last year, Bill Williams took over as interim CEO, replacing Michael Kenyon. At the time, Gowans replaced Alex Morrison as chairperson. Detour’s flagship asset, the Detour Lake mine, is located in north-eastern Ontario. The mine is forecast to produce between 507 000 oz and 605 000 oz this year.
