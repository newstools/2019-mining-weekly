LUSAKA – Glencore's Zambian unit Mopani Copper Mines said on Friday it had suspended operations at its Mindola north shaft after three workers were killed in a fire accident. Mopani is one the biggest mining companies in Zambia – Africa's No. 2 producer of the metal – with an output of around 100 000 t/y. It was not immediately clear how much production would be lost owing to the suspended production.
