Gold and zinc explorer Connemara Mining on Tuesday announced a proposed name change to Arkle Resources. The name change, while reflecting the companyâ€™s heritage as an Ireland-based business established to focus on zinc assets, would better reflect its diversified position in gold and zinc exploration and resource development, Connemara explained. A resolution to change the name of the company would be proposed at an extraordinary general meeting to be held on March 12, in Dublin.
