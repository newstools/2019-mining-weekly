PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Mining major Rio Tinto is hoping to leverage is fossil-fuel-free portfolio to assist in reducing its carbon footprint, and to help battle climate change. “Given our decision to strengthen our business and exit coal, we are now the only major mining company with a fossil-fuel-free portfolio, which means we are well-positioned to contribute to a low-carbon future,” said Rio CEO Jean-Sebastian Jacques on Wednesday. “The materials we produce, from infinitely recyclable aluminium, to copper used in electrification, to our higher grade iron-ore product, all play a part in the transition to a low-carbon economy.” Rio on Wednesday launched its climate change report, using recommendations from the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, as a framework to assess the potential risks and opportunities of climate change. The company has outlined that it would take action on four key areas: supplying essential metals and minerals for the transition to a low-carbon economy, reducing emissions from its own footprint, identifying and assessing physical risk exposures, and partnering to advance climate goals. “At Rio Tinto, we have reduced our emissions-intensity footprint by almost 30% since 2008, putting us on track to beat our targets. Renewable energy is now used to produce nearly three-quarters of the electricity we use,” Jacques said. “We are aware that we have more to consider on climate change and will work with partners such as the members of the Energy Transitions Commission, Alcoa and Apple, the World Bank and others, to look at further sustainable solutions that enable us to continue to generate profits and contribute to people, the planet and prosperity.”
