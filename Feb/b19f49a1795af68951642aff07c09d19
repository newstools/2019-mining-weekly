Gold junior Galantas Gold is continuing to advance the Omagh underground mine in Northern Ireland and has now intersected the Kearney vein on a second mining level. The miner has progressed the main decline development tunnel to 52 m past a 50-m-long access branch on the 1Â 084 level (second level), driven east from the main decline tunnel to its injunction with the Kearney vein, north of the planned mining area. A southwards on-vein development, on the Kearney vein, on the 1 084 level, to access beneath the first mining area, has started. Galantas says the interval between the levels is planned to be mined by a long-hole method, using cemented rock and tailings as backfill support. The company notes that drill-core OM-DD-06-14 has intersected strong gold mineralisation some 7 m to the south of the junction of the 1 084 access and the Kearney vein. This core returned an intersection of grade 10.3 g/t gold over a down-hole length of 3 m. This included 1 m at 27.42 g/t gold, 170.84 g/t silver and 6.52% lead. Further, Galantas reports that the main decline development continues towards the 1 072 level to enable the mining of the next production sequence. A further 43 m remains to be excavated on the decline to reach the 1 072 level, before making a 58 m vein access drive. On-vein drivage on the 1 072 level, which is the third level in the vertical sequence, is planned to provide future mining access. In addition, an access tunnel westwards from the decline tunnel, towards the Joshua vein has been continued and currently has been driven a total of 56 m out of an anticipated 344 m. A second means of egress that is required as an escapeway and to form a ventilation circuit, has been completed. Arrangements are being put in place to install the mine main ventilation fans which have already been delivered to site.
