PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Queensland’s exports grew to A$81.7-billion in 2018, up 16% on the last year, with the resources sector accounting for 80% of the state’s exports. The Queensland Resources Council (QRC) on Wednesday said that Queensland coal exports had increased by more than 15% in value over the 12 months to December, as coal became Australia’s largest export earner, earning A$66-billion in revenues. Resources Minister Matt Canavan has noted that the value of 2018 coal exports Australia-wide was up 16% on the previous year’s A$57-billion and across the board resources exports were up 20% on the previous year’s A$206-billion. QRC CEO Ian Macfarlane noted that Queensland’s coal exports were worth some A$35.7-billion in 2018. “That coal is exported to build cities and infrastructure around the world, and to provide high-efficiency, low-emissions energy. In return our exports bring in returns for all Queenslanders to build schools, roads and hospitals and pay for teachers, nurses and police,” Macfarlane said. The resources sector is expected to pay a record A$5.2-billion in royalty taxes to boost the Queensland budget. “Our resources sector has created these returns while using just 0.1% of the state’s land, and while working cooperatively with other industries such as agriculture and tourism. “A strong resources sector delivers benefits for all Queenslanders, not only the 316 000 people who work in the sector or in associated jobs. These values reinforce the need for an investment pipeline for the future, to keep delivering returns through new projects.”
