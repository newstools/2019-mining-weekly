TSX-listed Wallbridge Mining reported on Thursday that it has produced and sold more than 13 300 oz of gold from the 35 000 t bulk sample under way at its Fenelon gold project, in Quebec. To date, about 25 000 t of ore with a reconciled average grade of 17.34 g/t gold containing more than 14 000 oz of gold has been processed at the Camflo mill in four separate mill runs. The company stated that stope grades were meeting expectations, ranging from 10.55 g/t to 33.32 g/t gold. It was on target to achieve total bulk sample production of about 35 000 t, grading 19 g/t to 22 g/t gold for production of 21 000 oz to 24 000 oz of gold. Wallbridge noted that it was planning an active 2019 programme, after the completion of the 35 000 t bulk sample, which would involve a total of 50 000 m to 75 000 m underground resource expansion and surface exploration drilling.
