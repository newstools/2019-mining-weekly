PERTH (miningweekly.com) â€“ Diamond miner Lucapa Diamond Company has recovered a 128 ct diamond from its Lulo alluvial mine, in Angola. The diamond is the twelfth stone over 100 ct to be recovered to date from the Lulo operation, which continued to underline the large-stone nature of the Lulo diamond field, said Lucapa. The diamond was recovered from Mining Block 6, along with a 7.5 ct fancy purple pink gem. Both of the diamonds will likely be included in the next international tender, along with the 75 ct diamond recovered in the fourth quarter of last year, as well as other Specials previously recovered.
