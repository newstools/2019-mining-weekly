Anglo American Platinum (Amplats) expects to report basic earnings of R6.5-billion for the year ended December 31 – a 289% increase on basic earnings reported for 2017. This translates to basic earnings a share of R25, compared with the R7.41 a share reported for 2017. Headline earnings are, meanwhile, expected to increase to R7.1-billion, or R27.10 a share, which is 83% higher than 2017’s R3.8-billion, or R14.80 apiece. Amplats said the expected increase in headline and basic earnings was primarily driven by a 13% increase in the rand basket price and improved operational performance, despite losses made on disposals, including that of the Union mine and MASA Chrome. Amplats will release its 2018 financial year results on February 18.
