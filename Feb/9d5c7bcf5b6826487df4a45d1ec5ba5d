HARARE – Zimbabwe’s government will review mining legislation to improve safety standards in the industry, after 24 miners died when two gold shafts collapsed, the Herald reported, citing Mines Minister Winston Chitando. “Obviously it is a learning point and we will, as government, have a serious review of this incident and come up with a policy position,” the State-controlled newspaper quoted Chitando as saying. Dozens of miners are still missing after the accident at the mining sites at Battlefields, 170 kilometers (106 miles) west of the capital, Harare, on February 13. Most of Zimbabwe’s gold is produced by small-scale miners, who mainly work in unsafe and disused mines.
