This will be the third diamond to be recovered at Kareevlei that is independently valued at more than $50 000. A diamond weighing 7.76 ct was recovered in 2017 and sold for $10 070 /ct and a diamond weighing 10.58 ct was recovered in 2018 and sold for $7 047 /ct. “The 8.97 ct stone recovered on February 1, along with two other high-quality diamonds [weighing 6.36 ct and 3.64 ct] reinforces the exceptional quality being produced at Kareevlei,” BlueRock CEO Adam Waugh enthused in a statement on Tuesday.
