PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The share price of ASX-listed Intrepid Mines fell by more than 6% on Wednesday after the company resurrected a merger agreement with fellow-listed AIC Resources. Intrepid’s initial off-market takeover bid for AIC fell flat earlier this year, after the company’s offer of one Intrepid share for every 3 AIC Resources shares failed to gain the necessary traction with shareholders. Intrepid said on Wednesday that the companies have re-engaged, having recognised the merits of combining the companies, and have agreed to revised terms. The new off-market takeover offer would see Intrepid offer one of its own shares for every three AIC shares held, with the combined entity including a combination of AIC and Intrepid directors. On the successful completion of the transaction Intrepid shareholders would hold a 27% share in the combined entity, with AIC shareholders holding the majority 73% interest. The two companies have argued that the merger would provide a number of benefits for both parties, including the delivery of a large contiguous land-holding which is highly prospective for both gold and copper, as well as a strong balance sheet which could potentially provide a springboard for future growth. The individual boards have unanimously recommended that shareholders accept the offer. As the merger would involve the issue of more than 100% of Intrepid’s issued capital, it has been classified as a ‘reverse takeover’, and would require Intrepid shareholder approval. The transaction would also be subject to a number of other conditions, including a 90% acceptance of AIC shares. Intrepid shares were trading at a low of 34c a share on Wednesday, down from an opening price of 36.5c a share, while AIC shares fell from an opening price of 17c a share to 16c a share.
