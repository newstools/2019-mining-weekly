PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Titan Minerals has completed wet commissioning of the Vista gold plant and mill, in Peru. The plant will have an initial 150 t/d capacity to generate some 90 oz/d of gold, based on average monthly grades of between 17.5 g/t and 24.4 g/t gold. The plant is permitted and designed to increase its capacity to 350 t/d. Titan said on Thursday that the company is currently completing operational tests during a 90-day period, following the environmental approval received in January. Once the Vista gold plant is fully operational, Titan is expecting a physical inspection by the Regional Energy and Mines Institute. This is one of the final stages for the issue of an operator’s permit. Once this permit is received, the Vista plant will be fully permitted and licensed to start commercial production. Titan earlier this month struck a merger agreement with TSX-V listed Core Gold to combine the companies into a Latin America-focused gold player. The combined group will have an ASX listing and a measured resource of 437 000 oz, an indicated resource of 585 000 oz and an inferred resource of some 1.1-million ounces at the Dynasty goldfield project in Ecuador, as well as a portfolio of highly prospective exploration projects across Ecuador and Peru.
