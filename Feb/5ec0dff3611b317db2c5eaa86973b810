The second phase of South America-focused Guyana Goldfields’ mill expansion is mechanically complete and was fully commissioned this week the TSX-listed miner reported on Thursday. The company expects the Phase 2 mill expansion to improve recovery by up to 2%, throughput by 10% and allow for 75% redundancy of the primary crusher. Given the higher-than-expected mill performance of the Phase 1 expansion, Guyana Goldfields reduced the scope of Phase 2 to only include the addition of a precrushing circuit, resulting in a capital saving of $2-million. The Phase 1 expansion in 2018 has delivered an average throughput of 7 000 t/d, compared with a design template of 6 600 t/d.
