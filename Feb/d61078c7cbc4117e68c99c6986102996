Gold explorer Bonterra Resources has announced that its corporate headquarters will move from Vancouver, British Columbia, to Val D’Or, Quebec, to bring its management closer to its main projects in the Urban Barry Camp. Chairperson and interim CEO Greg Gibson said on Monday that combining management with the operations and exploration office already in place in Val D’Or would improve efficiency and allow management to take part in the communities where the company operated. Further, Bonterra announced the appointment of James Fairbairn as CFO, replacing Joseph Meagher, who had resigned. Fairbairn was CFO of Metanor Resources, which Bonterra acquired last year and is thus well acquainted with the operations of the company.
