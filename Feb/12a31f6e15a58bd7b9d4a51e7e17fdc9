Aim-listed gold producer Nordgold announced on Thursday that a new mining permit for its Lefa mine – one of Guinea’s largest gold producing mines – will be effective from March 21. The permit, as well as the convention that was renewed last year, was extended for 15 years, in line with Lefa’s current life-of-mine. Nordgold expects to invest over $360-million in Lefa’s development over its life. It has already invested about $1-billion in Guinea since acquiring the mine in 2010. The company stated that its concern for, and awareness of, the needs of the local community was an integral part of its presence in all of the regions in which it operates. “The Lefa mine invested significantly to improve the provision of local health services and education, including support for the fight against Ebola, as well as the creation of new medical facilities and some 40 schools. “The mine also offers continuous support to the agricultural and food supply activities of the local citizens, as well as organising access to fresh water through [the drilling of] water boreholes,” Nordgold stated. Lefa contributed almost $12-million to empowering the local communities and it intends to continue its investments, with the aim of improving people’s living conditions for the life-of-mine and beyond. Lefa provides direct employment for almost 1 200 employees, as well as over 730 indirect jobs. Ninety per cent of its employees are nationals.
