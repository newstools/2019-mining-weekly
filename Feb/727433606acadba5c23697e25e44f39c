PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Greater Southern Mining will raise up to A$5-million through a share placement to fund exploration work at its Laverton and North Queensland operations. The company told shareholders that the issue price and the corresponding number of shares to be issued would still be determined, with the raising to be subject to shareholder approval at a shareholder meeting on March 7. “With the recent discovery of a new gold deposit and mineralised system at the Mon Ami gold project, the company has the potential to add ounces to the deposit through a thoroughly planned and comprehensive extensional and infill drilling programme,” said Great Southern executive chairperson John Terpu. “We have also announced promising exploration results on the North Queensland assets south of the Mt Carlton gold mine. The area remains underexplored for gold with recent site visits and mapping programmes in January identifying several targets with a drilling programme being planned.”
