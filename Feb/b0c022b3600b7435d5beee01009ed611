North-American-focused base and precious metals developer Phoenix Global Mining has announced the final assays from a drilling programme at its 2018 Empire copper project, in Idaho. The results shared on Monday showed sulphide copper values of 7.14% copper, 5.94 g/t of gold and 76 g/t of silver over 1.5 m outside of the resource pit shell. The company said an updated mineral resource was under way. “We are pleased to present the results of the last seven drill holes from the 2018 Empire drill programme.  The results include infill and stepout drilling in the north-western portion of the Empire property and are consistent with our expectations. “Of particular note is the high-grade sulphide intercept of 12.80% copper equivalent in drill hole KX18-62.  This drill hole intercept aligns with a nearby, historically drilled intercept of similar sulphide grade and adds credence to the larger, high-grade sulphide picture that is beginning to develop,” said CEO Dennis Thomas. In addition, the KX18-62 sulphide intercept is open to the west and at depth. “The infill and stepout drilling results in the oxides continue to show robust results, with 1.5 m of 2.11% copper equivalent and 4.6 m of 1.10% copper equivalent in holes KX18-58 and KX18-59, respectively. “On another note, the last of the 2018 rock chip sample assays for our Bighorn and Redcastle cobalt projects in Lemhi ounty, Idaho have been received and we look forward to presenting those results in the very near future,” added Thomas. Phoenix has now completed a total of 8 604 m of drilling at the Empire mine, consisting of 6 328 m of reverse circulation drilling and 2 276 m of diamond drilling.
