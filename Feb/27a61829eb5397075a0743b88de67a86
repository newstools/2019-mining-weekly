CAPE TOWN (miningweekly.com) – When Eskom had 32 000 employees, debt of R40-billion and an output of 40 000 MW, it was a world-beater, Eskom group CE Phakamani Hadebe said on Monday. But its current employee level of 47 000 employees, debt of R440-billion and output of only 38 000 MW are presenting major turn-around challenges. Hadebe told the Investing in African Mining Indaba that Eskom’s costs were excessive; its debt was being serviced from borrowings and three South Africa banks, in addition to multilateral lenders, were against the funding of coal-based power generation. Eskom’s expenditure on environmental protection was insufficient to satisfy the laid-down requirements and clean coal efforts were not yet sufficient to open the way for coal-based expansion. Shareholder capital assistance and tariff increases were now needed to bolster Eskom’s own cost-cutting efforts, which have included capital expenditure and operational expenditure reductions. He identified the operational problems as being mainly due to maintenance not being undertaken at the correct level, new-build power stations contributing less than expected, power station ageing and coal stocks being below the required level.
