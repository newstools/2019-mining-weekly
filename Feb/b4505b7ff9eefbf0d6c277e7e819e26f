Aim-listed emerging phosphate producer Kropz has appointed Jan Steenkamp MD of the company’s 74%-owned Elandsfontein project, in South Africa’s Western Cape province. Steenkamp is a South African mining industry veteran and has managed mining operations across a number of commodities. He also serves as a nonexecutive director to diversified miner African Rainbow Minerals (ARM). ARM is associated with Kropz’s shareholder Africa Rainbow Capital. Kropz has invested $120-million in Elandsfontein’s exploration, bulk sampling, feasibility studies and the subsequent construction of a mine, mineral processing facility and associated infrastructure. The company anticipates first ore to be produced by the end of this year. The mine will ramp up to steady-state production of one-million tonnes a year during 2020, at a grade of around 32% phosphate rock concentrate. Steenkamp has been tasked with developing the operational team and driving the project through to commercial production. Results from metallurgical testwork at the mine are on track to be released during the first half of the year.
