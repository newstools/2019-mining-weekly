Canadian gold exploration company Probe Metals on Tuesday reported new results from the 2018 drill programme on the Val-d’Or East Courvan property area, in Quebec, which identified both new discoveries, as well as confirmed significant expansion of previous discoveries north and west of the former Bussiere mine. The TSX-V-listed company has intersected 9.6 g/t gold over 9 m and 3.2 g/t gold over 10 m, expanding the east side of the Creek zone, about 1 km north of Bussiere. The two new discoveries graded 8.4 g/t gold over 5 m, 4 g/t gold over 7 m and 4.9 g/t gold over 9 m, and are located about 450 m and 750 m, respectively, north of the Creek zone. President and CEO David Palmer said that, in a very short space of time, the Courvan property had been elevated into a priority area for generating potential new gold resources. The area, which is characterised by thick, high-grade gold zones, is interpreted to be part of the same system responsible for the mineralisation that comprises the current National Instrument 43-101 gold resource, located 1.5 km to the east. The Courvan area, as well as the ground in between, has become a priority focus for the winter drill programme as Probe looks to extend the mineralised zones and expand its resource base, Palmer added. The 2018 drilling programme at Courvan has allowed the identification of 12 new gold structures over an area of 2.5 km by 1 km around the old Bussiere mine, all located within a short distance of the company’s current resources. The mineralised zones are similar to those observed along the Pascalis trend with large envelopes of quarts and tourmaline veins, and associated alteration, the company said, adding that visible gold is common within the mineralisation.
