PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Construction has started on the Project Atlas pipeline, in Queensland, energy infrastructure developer Jemena has announced. Project Atlas is the first acreage in Australia designated solely to supply gas to the domestic market, and includes a 40 TJ/d natural gas processing facility and a 60-km buried pipeline that would transport gas from ASX-listed Senex Energy’s Project Atlas to the Walumbilla Hub. Senex MD and CEO Ian Davies on Monday said that he was pleased with the start of construction of the natural gas pipeline. “Senex is making excellent progress in the development of Project Atlas, with first gas deliveries to the domestic gas market planned for late 2019. The start of pipeline construction works by Jemena is an important milestone in delivering much-needed natural gas to the east coast market.” Senex and Jemena will invest some A$400-million to bring gas from Project Atlas and the nearby Roma North development to market, Davies said, generating job opportunities and material royalties for the Queensland government.
