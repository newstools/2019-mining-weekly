Colombia’s largest underground gold and silver producer, TSX-listed Gran Colombia, has increased its guidance for 2019 to between 225 000 oz and 240 000 oz. The new guidance compares with a previous range of 210 000 oz to 225 000 oz, and follows a strong six-month period. The miner produced 18 882 oz of gold in June, bringing the second quarter total to 57 882 oz, up 9% on the prior-year quarter. For the first half of 2019, production increased by 12% year-on-year to 118 483 oz, which brought the trailing 12 months’ total at the end of June to 230 906 oz, or 6% higher than 2018’s yearly production. Commenting on the production results, CEO Lombardo Paredes said the strong operating performance of the quarter was led by its flagship Segovia Operations.
