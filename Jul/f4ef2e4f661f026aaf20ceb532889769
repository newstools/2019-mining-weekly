An improved rand platinum-group metals (PGMs) basket price and improved operational performances during the financial year ended June 30 are expected to result in platinum miner Impala Platinum (Implats) reporting basic and headline earnings a share for the period. This compared with the basic and headline loss a share of 1 486c and 171c, respectively, reported for the 2018 financial year. Basic earnings in the comparative period had been negatively impacted on by impairments of R9.7-billion, or 1 350c a share, after-tax. Meanwhile, Implats on Monday said its refined platinum production for the 2019 financial year had increased by about 4% to just over 1.5-million ounces. This increase is primarily as a result of an improved performance from Impala Rustenburg and a stock release of platinum compared with a build-up in the comparative period. Results for the full-year are expected to be released on or about September 5.
