Mining investment company Menar’s Zululand Anthracite Colliery (ZAC) subsidiary has appointed Siyabonga Mathonsi as its first black GM since mining operations began in 1987. His appointed is effective July 15. Menar acquired ZAC from Rio Tinto in 2016 and returned it to profitability. Mathonsi’s career at ZAC began in 2008, when he served as an engineer-in-training. In 2010, he was promoted to a junior engineer and then to section engineer in 2015. A year later, he became engineering manager, a post he retained until his promotion to GM. Menar MD Vuslat Bayoglu says Mathonsi is a hard-working professional who worked his way up the management ladder. “The appointment is a clear demonstration that, with adequate training and experience, coupled with the commitment to redressing the legacy of Apartheid, substantive transformation is achievable,” he states. Outgoing GM Bradley Hammond will step into a new role as Menar group COO. Bayoglu says Mathonsi has played an important role in the turnaround of the mine, while serving as a second in command to Hammond. “They worked as a team. Siyabonga is a team player with excellent human relations skills. We look forward to seeing him and the team drive the extension of the life of mine beyond the projected 12 years.”
