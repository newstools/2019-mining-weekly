Canadian base metals miner Lundin Mining on Friday announced that it had successfully completed the 100% acquisition of Mineração Maracá Indústria e Comércio, a mining company that owns the Chapada copper/gold mine, in Brazil. Lundin in April announced its plans to buy the company from Yamana Gold for $800-million. “The addition of Chapada further solidifies Lundin’s position as a leading intermediate base metals producer. Leveraging our technical expertise, base metals focus and financial strength, we believe more opportunities exist to create meaningful stakeholder value from this high-quality asset,” said Lundin president and CEO Marie Inkster. The terms of the transaction specify that Yamana retains a 2% net smelter return royalty on future gold production from the Suruca gold deposit at the mine, while receiving contingent considerations of up to $125-million over five years if certain gold price thresholds are met and a contingent consideration of $100-million on potential construction of a pyrite roaster.
