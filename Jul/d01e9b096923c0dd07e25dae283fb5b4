TSX-listed Guyana Goldfields has suspended operations at its Aurora mine, in Guyana, after a portion of the workforce employed by the company's wholly owned subsidiary, AGM, blocked the delivery of ore to the mill earlier this week. While it seeks a resolution with striking workers, it has evacuated all non-essential personnel from site, including the striking workers. “The company believes the stoppage was the result of a misunderstanding concerning the management and relationship between AGM and certain openpit mining contractors. “AGM has been examining options to improve mining performance in order to ensure Aurora's long-term future. No decisions have been made concerning any possible changes to the mining operation at this time,” Guyana said in a statement issued on Wednesday. The company indicated that it was actively working with its employees and adhering to applicable laws and regulations, as well as facilitating communication with the relevant governmental labour authorities to understand and address employees’ concerns and to resolve the matter as quickly as possible. The company is undertaking arrangements to have the strikers meet with representatives of the Ministry of Labour to mediate the dispute. Work on the underground exploration decline was unaffected.
