Aim-listed BlueRock Diamonds has sold a 12.2 ct diamond for $105 000 in its July tender. This diamond, at $8 584/ct, was the second-most valuable diamond the company had recovered to date, following the sale of a 24.9 ct diamond in the June tender for $196 000. BlueRock executive chairperson Mike Houston attributed the great recoveries to improved operational practices at the company’s Kareevlei diamond mine, in South Africa’s Northern Cape province.
