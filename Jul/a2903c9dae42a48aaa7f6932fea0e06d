The Malawian government has granted TSX-V- and Aim-listed Mkango Resources a new and exclusive three-year prospecting licence in the Mchinji district, adjacent to licences with known nickel/cobalt resources. Mkango will evaluate all historical data over the 868 km2 licence area and exploration will mainly target nickel and cobalt, as well as gold, graphite and potentially other base metals. The licence also grants the company the right to explore for platinum group metals, ilmenite, vanadium, chrome, uranium and rare earth elements. The company now holds interests in four exclusive prospecting licences in Malawi â€“ Phalombe, Thambani, Chimimbe Hill and now Mchinji. Mkango is, meanwhile, also progressing a feasibility study for the Songwe Hill rare earths project, in Malawi.
