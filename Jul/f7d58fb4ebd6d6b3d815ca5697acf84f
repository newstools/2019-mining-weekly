Aim-listed Cora Gold on Monday confirmed assay results demonstrating an extension at depth of high-grade gold mineralisation at the Zone A prospect at the Sanankoro gold discovery, in Mali. Grades returned from two reverse circulation (RC) drill holes at between 90 m and 100 m from surface included 27 m at 2.43 g/t gold and 36 m at 2.40 g/t gold. Upcoming assay results include a 212 m orientated core hold completed at Zone A to test for sulphide gold mineralisation at depth. CEO Jonathan Forster noted in a statement that the two RC holes had demonstrated the continuity of high grades at Sanankoro that were present along strike and also to depths of more than 100 m at the Zone A prospect. “The depth of oxidation in this part of Zone A appears to be around 110 m, enhancing the prospect's overall mineability, which would likely consist of an openpit operation with potential for depth extensions. “The results of these two holes are an important step in the objective of identifying potential starter pit areas for any future mining project.” Forster said the results highlighted the apparent northerly plunge of the higher-grade zone, which remained open to depth and as such remained an attractive exploration target. “This latest drill programme has highlighted the inherent potential at Sanankoro that is still to be fully realised and I look forward to updating shareholders with further upcoming results."
