Canadian junior explorer Giyani Metals has received final approvals from the Botswana Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA) to implement environmental management plans (EMPs) at its K.Hill and Otse manganese projects. The final approval was granted after the customary one-month public review process, during which the TSX-V-listed company was required to advertise the details of the EMPs in the Government Gazette and local newspapers. No concerns were raised by any stakeholders for either site during the period, Giyani said on Friday. The company had submitted three initial EMPs for its Botswana manganese prospects K.Hill, Otse and Lobatse, in late 2018 and early this year; following which the company submitted updated EMPs based on comments and clarifications received from the DEA after the first round of submissions. Initial approval of its third EMP for Lobatse, which was resubmitted on June 24, with responses to comments from the DEA, was still outstanding. Giyani CEO Robin Birchall said the company could now shift its focus to the implementation phase to start the remediation work at K.Hill and Otse, which would improve the environmental conditions at both sites. Simultaneously, the work will enable Giyani to process the resulting material and generate revenues to facilitate the development of the overall project.
