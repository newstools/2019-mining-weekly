PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Graphite miner Bass Metals has signed an agency agreement to supply graphite concentrates from its Graphmada project, in Madagascar, into the Indian market. The exclusive agency agreement with industrial minerals group Polo Queen Minchems provides the Indian company with an exclusive in-country opportunity to market and sell the Bass concentrates, while still allowing Bass to sell its concentrate to other parties outside of India for supply into this market. “We are delighted to have formalized this opportunity for Bass. The company’s senior management team and I see the growth in the Indian market as a significant opportunity for Bass,” said CEO Tim McManus. “The demand-supply and logistical advantages Madagascar has, with its high quality concentrates, make this a very cost-effective business case.” McManus said that Bass has developed a strong supply chain network in India, providing the company with a unique and rare opportunity to provide the Graphmada product to fill demand. Furthermore, with China importing more graphite from other parts of the world, including Africa, the Indian market and its manufacturers have turned their attention to Madagascar as a supplier of graphite to the market. “While we will continue to supply our premium graphite concentrate to buyers in the US and Germany, it is pleasing to have yet another supply agreement in place. This is a great strategic outcome to have yet another market for our product to take our short-term production and supply increases.”
