Dual-listed Altus Strategies’ wholly owned subsidiary Aeos Resources has signed an option agreement with Firering Holdings in respect of the former’s application for the Toura nickel/cobalt licence, in the west of Côte d'Ivoire. If Aeos is granted the Toura licence and, should Firering exercise its option, Firering will pay Altus €15 000 in cash and Aeos will transfer a 95% interest in its locally incorporated and 100%-owned subsidiary Apalex to Firering. Aeos will also be granted a royalty on gross revenues generated by the sale of ore minerals mined from Toura, net of transportation costs. The royalty will be subject to a separate agreement, which will be entered into between Aeos and Firering, within six months of the grant of the application. The option agreement will be replaced by a shareholders’ agreement within 30 days of the exercise of the option by Firering. “We are delighted to sign this option agreement with Firering on the Toura nickel/cobalt project in western Côte d'Ivoire,” said Altus CE Steven Poulton in a statement released on Thursday. He highlighted that Toura was strategically located within an emerging and prospective nickel/cobalt province. “We look forward to the grant of the application and to working with Firering thereafter.”
