SAO PAULO â€“ Brazilian miner Vale has been authorised to partially resume dry processing operations at its Vargem Grande complex, which should add five-million tonnes to annual production, the company said in a securities filing on Tuesday. Brazil's mining regulatory agency had ordered Vale to halt operations at Vargem Grande in February to guarantee the stability of its dams. Vale reaffirmed its guidance for iron ore and pellets sales at 307-million to 332-million tonnes in 2019.
