The Department of Mineral Resources has granted a Section 11 approval for the transfer of Rustenburg Platinum Mine’s (RPM’s) 33% undivided interest in the mining rights attributable to the Bafokeng Rasimone Platinum Mine (BRPM) joint venture to Royal Bafokeng Platinum (RBPlat). RPM, a wholly owned subsidiary of Anglo American Platinum, in July 2018 accepted a R1.8-billion offer from RBPlat for the 33% interest in BRPM. With the Section 11 approval, all conditions for the transfer of all BRPM mining rights to RBPlat have been met.
