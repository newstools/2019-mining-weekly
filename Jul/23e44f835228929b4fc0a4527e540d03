NYSE- and TSX-listed Endeavour Silver has acquired exploration and exploitation rights to two properties adjacent to the Guanacevi mine in Durango state, Mexico. The 15-ha El Porvenir property sits adjacent to the operating Porvenir Norte mine and covers the up-dip extension of the Porvenir Norte orebody. Endeavour had a similar exploration and exploitation right on this property between 2006 and 2008, during which time the company conducted exploration drilling and small scale mining. Previously estimated reserves and resources remain available for development and production, albeit at higher silver prices. The 40-ha El Curso property lies adjacent to the now-closed Porvenir Cuatro mine and covers any possible north-west extension of the Porvenir Cuatro orebody. Porvenir Cuatro was previously Endeavour’s highest grade mine in the district. Mining at Porvenir Cuatro ended in 2018 at the boundary with the El Curso property. The current mine access ramp from Porvenir Cuatro to Milache crosses the entire El Curso property so Endeavour has existing underground access and infrastructure to facilitate the exploration, development and production of El Curso. “After many years of discussions, we are happy to announce this exploration and exploitation agreement. It gives us access to two key properties adjacent to two of our past mines at Guanacevi in order to explore, develop and produce any extensions of the Porvenir Norte and Porvenir Cuatro orebodies. Subject to successful exploration, we not only have the opportunity to extend the mine life at Guanacevi but also to commence development and initial production from the El Curso property this year,” said Endeavour CEO Bradford Cooke.
