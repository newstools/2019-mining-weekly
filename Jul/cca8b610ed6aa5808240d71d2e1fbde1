ASX- and Aim-listed Base Resources has returned its mining rates to nameplate capacity, after having transitioned activity at its Kwale mineral sands operation, in Kenya, to the South Dune orebody. The company on Tuesday said that while the transition of mining operations had been under way, the Kwale mineral separation plant had operated on stockpiled heavy mineral concentrate throughput, to ensure uninterrupted production. Preparations for the transition to the South Dune orebody primarily involved the installation of 7 400 m of slurry and water piping, an 8 500 m 11 kV power line, a bridge across the Mukurumudzi dam spillway, a 1.25 MW slurry booster pump and a 1 MW process water booster pump. “The transition of mining operations from the fully depleted Central Dune orebody to the South Dune orebody took place over a two-week period and involved moving the hydraulic mining units and the commissioning of the new pumps, pipes and power supply. “We have been planning for this transition of mining for over a year and it is a testament to the professionalism of the team that the move was completed on schedule and without incident,” said Base operations and development executive director Colin Bwye.
