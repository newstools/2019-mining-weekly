PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Orion Mining has started a number of work streams following the release of a positive bankable feasibility study (BFS) for its Prieska copper/zinc project, in South Africa. Orion on Tuesday said that work has now started on completing pilot-scale field trials on various aspects of mine dewatering, including the testing of water qualities, refining the proposed pumping system, and investigating means of cost-effective water treatment. Orion will also follow up on the optimisation opportunities identified in the BFS, including mine-to-market enterprise optimisation of the foundation phase mining plans, while work is also under way to formalize key supply contracts to fast-track pre-construction activities and to lock in competitive pricing for critical plant and equipment. “We identified numerous opportunities to improve on the foundation phase mining plan during the BFS process. In our opinion, these opportunities can result in quantum improvements in the already pleasing project financial returns and risk profile,” said Orion MD and CEO Errol Smart. “We are thus making use of the time, while securing and formalising project funding, to ensure that the project execution incorporates as many of these improvements as possible, further de-risking the project and providing for the best commercial outcome.” The Prieska BFS estimated that the 2.4-million-tonne-a-year operation would require a capital investment of A$378-million, with the ten-year foundation phase expected to produce 189 000 t of copper and 580 000 t of zinc.
