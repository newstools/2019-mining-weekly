NYSE-listed Fluor Corporation has been awarded an engineering, procurement and construction management (EPCM) contract by Cupric Canyon Capital for its Khoemacau copper/silver project, in Botswana. The contract will include upgrading the existing copper concentrator plant and new mine surface infrastructure. "We worked closely with Cupric Canyon in the project’s front-end engineering and design phase to establish a capital-efficient design and execution plan for the project. “Fluor was also involved in construction management of the early works for the camp upgrade, bush clearing, transport corridor and surface infrastructure terrace preparation,” Fluor Mining and Metals president Tony Morgan commented in a release published on Tuesday. Khoemacau is expected to produce an average of 62 000 t/y of copper and 1.9-million ounces a year of silver and has a life of mine in excess of 20 years. “We will leverage our local capabilities and extensive copper experience to execute the Khoemacau project with excellence – safely, on time, on budget and with quality,” said Morgan.
