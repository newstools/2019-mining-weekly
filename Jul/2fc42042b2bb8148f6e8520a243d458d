NYSE-listed gold mining company Newmont Goldcorp on Sunday reported that partial underground operations at its Red Lake mine in Ontario would resume by Tuesday. Underground mining was paused last week to allow for the installation of additional controls to further protect workers in the event of water entering the mine through an historic stope at the Cochenour complex. The company said that although there were no known changes to conditions at the mine, the temporary halt in underground mining was a proactive measure, which followed an in-depth review of an historic stope at Cochenour. Processing and other surface operations at the mine have continued uninterrupted and underground workers were temporarily reassigned to jobs at the mill and other surface facilities. The Red Lake mining district is located 180 km north of Dryden, about 100 km from the Manitoba border in north-western Ontario. Mining operations include the Red Lake and Campbell underground mining and processing complexes, as well as Cochenour. The Red Lake mining district has been in operation since 1949.
