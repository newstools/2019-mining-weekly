The Maules Creek operation contributed a record 11.7-million tonnes of RoM production during the full year, while the Narrabri mine exceeded expectations at 6.4-million tonnes, above the guidance of between 5.6-million and 6-million tonnes. The Gunnedah opencut mines delivered an additional 5.1-million tonnes of RoM production in the full year, which was also slightly above guidance.
