PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Junior Diatreme Resources has inked a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with China’s Fengsha Group to potentially supply 500 000 t/y of photovoltaic grade silica sand from the Galalar silica project, in North Queensland. Diatreme CEO Neil McIntyre said on Tuesday that the MoU was a significant agreement for Diatreme as the company worked to unlock the potential of the Galalar project. “The Chinese market consumes approximately one-third of the world’s industrial silica and we have identified and started the first stage of an important relationship with China’s largest supplier and processor of photovoltaic and high-end silica sand product. It is our intention to form a significant part of the long-term supply solution in a market that is undergoing significant and constant demand growth.” Fengsha and Diatreme will also undertake further silica product testing to examine the potential for Diatreme to supply an additional 250 000 t/y of photovoltaic quality sand for further specialised processing by Fengsha.
