Vancouver-headquartered Pure Gold Mining on Tuesday announced that its 2019 surface drilling exploration programme had delivered several bonanza-grade gold intercepts, including 108.5 g/t gold over 1 m at Madsen Red Lake, in Ontario. The company reported that surface drilling at the Wedge deposit of Madsen had demonstrated the potential for these zones to grow, with gold intercepts returned both up- and down-plunge of the current mineral resource. Drilling result highlights include 108.5 g/t gold over 1.0 m from drill hole PG19-643, 94.6 g/t gold over 1.0 m from drill hole PG19-654 and 13.8 g/t gold over 1.0 m from drill hole PG19-649. Pure Gold said that two drill rigs were currently active on the project with one rig targeting growth at the Wedge resource, and the other testing the Fork EXT target. “This first round of results continues to demonstrate the continuity of our geological model and has reinforced the high grade nature of both the Wedge deposit and the broader Madsen gold system as a whole,” stated president and CEO Darin Labrenz. “In less than two years, we have made a new discovery at Wedge, established it firmly as part of a related, 5-km-long gold system and have rapidly developed a brand new mineral resource in the Red Lake mining district. With this understanding of the scale and tenor of gold mineralisation firmly established, we are now drilling to expand and define this extensive gold system.” The 2019 exploration programme focuses on the Wedge deposit and along strike extensions with a goal of growing and upgrading the gold resources. Initial discovery drilling in 2018 quickly established a high grade mineral resource at Wedge with a current indicated resource of 107 000 oz of gold at 10.3 g/t gold (in 322 000 t), and an inferred resource of 79 000 oz of gold at 8.0 g/t gold (in 307 000 t). In addition to ongoing exploration at Wedge, the current drilling campaign also includes the initial testing of the Fork EXT target, which is located down-plunge of the near-surface Fork deposit and hosts strong alteration, blue-grey quartz veins, and anomalous gold in limited past drill testing. The company’s 12 000 m drill programme is expected to be completed in December.
