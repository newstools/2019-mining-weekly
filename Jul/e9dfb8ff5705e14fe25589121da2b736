PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Gold miner Ramelius Resources has delivered another solid quarter of production for the three months to June, with the ASX-listed miner producing 47 342 oz during the quarter. The June quarterly production was well within the guidance of between 45 000 oz and 50 000 oz. In the full year, production reached 196 679 oz, which was also within the guided 190 000 oz to 210 000 oz. “We are very pleased that the operations team has delivered on guidance once again,” said Ramelius MD Mark Zeptner on Wednesday. “Production at Mt Magnet increased 19% on the prior quarter with higher grade feed becoming available from the openpit mines, as well as ore from the high-grade Hill 60 underground. Significant progress was made in the establishment and pre-stripping of the Eridanus openpit, with ore mining to commence early in the 2020 financial year.” Zeptner noted that at the Vivien operation, production was comparable with the previous quarter, as mining continued in higher-grade stoping areas, and the progress of the Edna May underground mine continued with development ore being processed during the quarter. Stoping activities at Edna May are scheduled to begin early in the September quarter.
