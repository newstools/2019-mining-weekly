LUBIN â€“ The chief executive of Polish miner KGHM expects copper prices to fluctuate around $6 000/t the end of the year, he said on Wednesday. "I do not see any reasons for a radical deterioration in price parameters. I think one should expect the copper price to oscillate around $6,000 per tonne by the end of the year," Marcin Chludzinski told Reuters. Benchmark copper on the London Metal Exchange was up 0.4% at $5 991/t by 09:54 GMT. Chludzinski did not rule out that KGHM may in future tap foreign markets with a bond issue, but did not expect any more debt issues this year.
