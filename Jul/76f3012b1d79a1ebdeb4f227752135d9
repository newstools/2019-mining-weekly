PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Grange Resources has flagged higher outputs at its Savage River iron-ore mine, in Tasmania, for the second half of 2019, as access to high-grade ore at the North Pit was established. Lower-grade ore has provided the feed for the Savage River operation over the last few months, resulting in lower head grades and reduced pellet production. The miner on Tuesday said that the access to the high-grade ore would allow a return to full production rates, with pellet production in the second half of the year expected to reach 1.2-million tonnes, with full-year production targeted for 2.1-million tonnes. For the second half of 2019, sales volumes are expected to reach 1.3-million tonnes, and 2.2-million tonnes for the full year. Grange has meanwhile told shareholders that the prefeasibility study for the underground operation at Savage River also continued to progress, with the study concluding in the first quarter of 2020. “The team will continue to focus on sustained delivery of high-grade ore to support full production rates for the balance of 2019. Progress on the feasibility study for potential underground mining continues to plan, and will inform our life-of-mine planning,” said Grange CEO M. Honglin Zhao.
