PERTH (miningweekly.com) â€“ Gold miner Troy Resources on Monday reported that despite missing its quarterly production targets, the Karouni mine, in Guyana, had reached its full-year potential. The ASX-listed Troy reported that gold production during the three months to June had reached 11 567 oz, slightly below the targeted 12 000 oz to 13 000 oz. However, full year production of 58 118 oz was within the guidance of between 58 000 oz and 60 000 oz. Troy told shareholders that the cut-back of the Smarts 3 pit had proceeded slower than planned, owing to difficult mining conditions during the wet season. The higher-grade Smarts 3 ore will likely be accessed by the end of July, or by early August.
