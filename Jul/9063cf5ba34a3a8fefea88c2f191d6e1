Precious metals miner SSR Mining, which operates mines in the US, Canada and Argentina, expects to meet or exceed its yearly production guidance for the eighth consecutive year, following a strong first half of 2019. The company is on track for higher yearly gold production, having produced more than 98 000 gold-equivalent ounces (GEOs) from its three operations during the second quarter, and more than 210 000 GEOs year-to-date. The Marigold mine, in Nevada, increased production by 3% quarter-on-quarter to 54 992 oz of gold, while increased gold grade and recovery led to 26 539 oz of gold production at the Seabee mine, in Saskatchewan. Its 75%-owned Puna Operations joint venture in Argentina, operated at planned rates and delivered 1.5-million ounces of silver. “At Marigold we stacked a higher amount of ore at an increasing gold grade, driving toward a record production year for the mine as we celebrate its 30th anniversary. At Seabee, production is ahead of plan, while at Puna, our focus was on achieving steady state production levels,” said president and CEO Paul Benson. Besides the three operating mines, SSR also has two feasibility stage projects and a portfolio of exploration properties in North and South America.
