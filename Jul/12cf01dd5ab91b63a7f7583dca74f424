PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The shareholders of Gindalbie Metals have voted in favour of a takeover offer from shareholder Ansteel. The 2.6c a share takeover offer from Ansteel was announced in March this year, allowing simultaneous plans to demerge Gindalbie’s subsidiary Coda Minerals, which holds the rights to a significant and strategic portfolio of tenements in South Australia. Gindalbie’s shareholders have voted in favour of both the demerger of Coda and the takeover offer from Ansteel. Gindalbie will now seek Federal Court approval for the two transactions at a hearing scheduled for July 8.
