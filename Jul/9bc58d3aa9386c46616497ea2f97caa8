PERTH (miningweekly.com) â€“ Lithium miner Galaxy Resources has reported a record quarter from its Mt Cattlin mine, in Western Australia, during the three months to June. The Mt Cattlin operation exceeded the production guidance of between 45 000 t and 50 000 t, producing 56 460 t of 6% lithium oxide during the quarter under review. At a unit cash cost of $337/t produced free-on-board, Mt Cattlin placed as one of the lowest cost lithium concentrate operations in the world, Galaxy said this week. A total of 29 439 t of lithium concentrates were shipped during the quarter, while a planned third shipment of 15 000 t, which was expected to depart Esperence port prior to the end of the second quarter, was delayed. This shipment will now form part of the schedule for the third quarter. Galaxy is targeting a lithium concentrate production of between 45 000 t and 55 000 t for the third quarter, with full-year guidance maintained at between 180 000 t and 210 000 t. The miner is expected to ship between 60 000 t and 70 000 t of lithium concentrate in the third quarter.
