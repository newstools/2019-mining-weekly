PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Todd River Resources has reported a maiden mineral resource estimate of 2.6-million tonnes, grading 10.5% zinc equivalent at the Hendrix deposit, within its greater Mt Hardy copper/zinc project, in the Northern Territory. The mineral resource contains some 175 000 t of zinc, 22 500 t of copper and 40 000 t of lead, Todd River said. “The maiden mineral resource shows that Hendrix is a robust discovery with strong grades and significant growth potential. Given the style of mineralisation, it would be unusual for the deposit to exist in isolation. We are confident that our ongoing exploration programme will lead to increases in the inventory at the Hendrix deposit and across our 100% held Mt Hardy project,” said MD Will Dix. “The Mt Hardy copper/zinc project has numerous high-priority targets nearby the Hendrix deposit and we look forward to commencing the next phase of drilling and other exploration work at Mt Hardy in August as part of our strategy to establish an Australian base metals project with both scale and high grades.” The August drilling programme is expected to run over a number of months.
