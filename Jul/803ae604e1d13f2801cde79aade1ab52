SANTIAGO – Chile's economic activity rose 2.3% in May from the same month a year ago, the central bank said on Friday, as the top copper producer´s crucial mining sector continued to lag. The IMACEC economic activity index encompasses about 90% of the economy tallied in gross domestic product figures. Mining activity in May dropped 2.3% compared with the same month in 2018 as the sector continued to confront sharply falling ore grades at its largest deposits.
