Anglo American Platinum (Amplats) still expects to achieve its full-year metal-in-concentrate production guidance of 4.2-million to 4.5-million platinum group metal (PGM) ounces. For the second quarter, its PGM output increased by 1% to 1.12-million ounces. Its own-managed mines’ PGM production decreased by 4% to 633 600 oz, owing to lower production from Mogalakwena and Mototolo. Joint venture PGM production also decreased by 4% to 228 200 oz, owing to lower volumes from Modikwa, despite a strong performance from Kroondal. The purchase of PGM concentrate from third parties, however, increased by 22% to 256 900 oz owing to higher volumes received from the Bafokeng Rasimone Platinum Mine and Siyanda Resources. Refined PGM production, including tolling, increased by 23% to 1.43-million ounces owing to improved processing operational performance and stability at processing assets. Amplats’ sales of 1.28-million ounces were in line with refined production, but 8% lower year-on-year.
