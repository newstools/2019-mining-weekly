Silver Lake has subscribed for 6.7-million shares in Encounter, at a price of 7.5c each. Encounter on Monday said that the company had received additional firm placement commitments from professional and sophisticated investors for some 11.7-million shares, including ASX-listed Independence Group, which will maintain its 9.2% interest in Encounter. “We are very pleased to welcome Silver Lake as a new substantial shareholder and the continuing support of Independence Group and other shareholders.
