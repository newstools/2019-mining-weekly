MEXICO CITY â€“ Shares of Mexican miner Penoles fell as much as 14% on the Mexican stock exchange Tuesday morning, reaching their weakest level in more than three years, after its Fresnillo subsidiary reported weak earnings. Fresnillo's core earnings declined by 46% during the first half of the year, hit by rising costs and lower output at its mines in Mexico. In a statement sent to the Mexican stock exchange, Penoles attributed the movement in its stock to Fresnillo's poor quarterly results.
