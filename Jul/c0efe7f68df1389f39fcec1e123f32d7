Platinum group metals and chrome miner Tharisa had a good start to its 2020 financial year, achieving a 2% quarter-on-quarter improvement in reef tonnes mined and a 5.4% quarter-on-quarter improvement in reef tonnes milled, for the quarter ended June 30. CEO Phoevos Pouroulis said in a statement on Tuesday that the solid quarter had followed a strong finish to the 2019 financial year. The JSE-, LSE- and A2X-listed company produced 34 100 oz of platinum, at a recovery rate of 82.1%, and 334 000 t of chrome, at a recovery rate of 65.5%, in the quarter under review. Pouroulis said the openpit redesign at the Tharisa mine in South Africa’s Bushveld Complex, had now been largely completed, which would contribute to increased tonnages mined and moved. As part of the ongoing pit redesign, the mine moved an additional 470 000 m3 of in-pit material during the quarter. Meanwhile, the company’s 27%-owned subsidiary in Zimbabwe, Karo Mining, had completed the first phase of a 206-hole, 30 km diamond core drilling campaign, in the Great Dyke region, on time and within budget. The company expects preliminary resource data to be available in November.
