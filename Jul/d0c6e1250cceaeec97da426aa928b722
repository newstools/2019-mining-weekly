PERTH (miningweekly.com) â€“ The shareholders of TSX-V-listed takeover target Atlantic Gold Corporation have voted in favour of an acquisition by gold miner St Barbara. The two companies in May this year struck a C$802-million takeover deal, under which St Barbara would acquire all of the outstanding shares in Atlantic for C$2.90 a share. The acquisition of Atlantic would give St Barbara ownership of the Moose River project, in Nova Scotia, where commercial production was declared in March of last year and where production reached 91 000 oz in 2018. The shareholders and option holders of Atlantic have overwhelmingly voted in favour of the transaction, with 99.6% of the votes cast. Atlantic will now seek a final order from the Supreme Court of British Columbia.
