Caledonia Mining’s Blanket mine, in Zimbabwe, produced 12 712 oz of gold in the second quarter ended June 30. While this was slightly below target, it was ahead of the 12 657 oz produced in the second quarter of 2018 and was also still at a level at which Caledonia was comfortable that it could still meet its full-year production guidance of 53 000 oz to 56 000 oz. Caledonia CEO Steve Curtis this week enthused that efforts to improve grade control had delivered results in the quarter, but would remain an area of focus. The company expects to complete the shaft sinking phase at the Central Shaft project later this month, which Curtis highlighted would be a significant milestone for the company. “We look forward to commencing production from the Central Shaft during the second half of 2020, which is expected to deliver the company’s growth plan to achieve 75 000 oz in 2021 and 80 000 oz by 2022.
