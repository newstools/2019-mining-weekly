Australia’s rough diamond output will decline from 14.2-million carats to 137 000 ct once the Argyle mine closes in 2021, says data and analytics company GlobalData. The company notes that the country’s rough diamond supply has been entirely reliant on output from the Argyle mine, in Western Australia, following the suspension of mining at the Ellendale mine in 2015, which followed the collapse of Kimberley Diamond Company in the same year. GlobalData senior mining analyst Vinneth Bajaj explains that the Western Australian government is doing rehabilitation work at the Ellendale mine, while seeking a new operator to restart mining activities. However, with no immediate potential to replace even part of the output of the Argyle mine, the country’s production will fall to less than 1% of current levels. From 2021, rough diamond output will come solely from Merlin Diamonds’ Merlin mine, which started full production in the third quarter of 2018. Nevertheless, various companies, including Lucapa Diamond Company, Merlin, Auteco Minerals, GeoCrystal and Legend International, are busy with ongoing exploration for diamonds - a “positive sign” that the Australian diamond industry could possibly be revived in future.
