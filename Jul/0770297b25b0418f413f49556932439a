PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Oil and gas major Beach Energy has reported a significant jump in production for the full year ended June, with the assimilation of the newly acquired Lattice Energy’s assets into its portfolio. Beach on Wednesday reported that production in the June quarter reached 6.97-million barrels of oil equivalent, down slightly from the 7.23-million barrels of oil equivalent achieved in the March quarter. However, for the full year ended June, production reached 29.39-million barrels, up from the 19-million barrels reported in the previous financial year. Sales volumes in the quarter were up 2%, to 7.69-million barrels, with volumes in the full year increasing from 20.1-million barrels to 31.18-million barrels, while sales revenue increased from A$1.25-billion to A$1.92-billion in the full year. “This is a strong performance, considering we only completed the Lattice acquisition less than 18 months ago. It is a testament to our diverse portfolio and our dedicated team,” said Beach MD Matt Kay. “Exceeding expectations over the past 18 months, provides Beach with an excellent platform to accelerate investment in growth across our value-accretive asset portfolio.”
