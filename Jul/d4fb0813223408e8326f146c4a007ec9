Ecuador-focused SolGold has appointed Ingo Hofmaier to the position of executive general manager for project and corporate finance, starting on September 9. Hofmaier joins SolGold from London-based investment banking firm Hannam & Partners, where he focused on mining investment banking. He was corporate broker to a dozen UK-listed mining stocks, and worked on the $3-billion financing of the Aluminium Bahrain 500 000 t aluminium smelter expansion, the recapitalisation of Kenmare Resources, the acquisition of Stillwater (by Sibanye) and Ivanhoe (by Rio Tinto), funded bulk and base metals mines into production and counted numerous global hedge funds and private equity investors among his clients over the years. "Ingo's appointment is very important for SolGold and underscores the company's commitment to the progression of the Cascabel project through prefeasibility and definitive feasibility by end 2020. “Ingo will be focusing on the establishment of a development financing solution for SolGold's share of development costs incurred by ENSA on the Cascabel project. His comprehensive understanding of SolGold and the project, his experience in debt and equity capital markets and financings of this nature, and his deep understanding of the global commodity markets, particularly copper and gold, auger well for delivery of the financing package,” said SolGold CEO Nick Mather. SolGold is manager of the Cascabel project held by Ecuador company ENSA, in which the firm owns 85%.
