Implats earlier this month invited bondholders to exercise their conversion rights. Following the conversion of the bonds, $200 000 of the aggregate principal amount of the bonds originally issued will remain outstanding. The company on Wednesday said it would make reasonable endeavours to accept, for conversion, the outstanding bond amount if a conversion notice is received by July 31.
