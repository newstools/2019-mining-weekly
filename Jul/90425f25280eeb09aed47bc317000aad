The Sasa and Kounrad operations that London-listed Central Asia Metals (CAML) own in Kazakhstan and north Macedonia, respectively, have achieved “another period of consistent delivery”, CEO Nigel Robinson said on Wednesday. The Kounrad solvent extraction and electrowinning copper plant produced 6 594 t of copper in the first half of 2019, compared with 6 747 t in the same six-month period of last year. The Sasa mine produce 11 517 t of zinc in concentrate and 14 357 t of lead in concentrate during the six month period, which was consistent with the 11 020 t of zinc and 14 386 t of lead produced a year earlier. The average head grades for the second-quarter period were 3.31% zinc and 3.68% lead, and for the first half of 2019 were on average 3.28% and 3.76% respectively. The average half-year metallurgical recoveries were 86.7% for zinc and 94.4% for lead. “Today's update demonstrates another period of consistent delivery from our low cost Sasa and Kounrad operations, and we are pleased to be on track to meet our 2019 production guidance for all three base metals,” said Robinson. CAML will report its half-year financial results on September 17.
