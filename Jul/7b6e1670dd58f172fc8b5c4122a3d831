Canada-headquartered diamond miner Lucara Diamond has chosen the name Sewelô, meaning “rare find” in Setswana, for the 1 758 ct diamond recovered from its Karowe mine, in Botswana, in April. The name was selected from over 22 000 submissions in a contest that was open to all Botswana citizens. The announcement was made during a gala event hosted by Lucara Botswana in the presence of Republic of Botswana President Dr Mokgweetsi Eric Keabetswe Masisi. The unbroken 1 758 ct stone was mined from the Eastern magmatic/pyroclastic kimberlite unit of the South Lobe and was recovered through Lucara’s X-ray transmission technology circuit in April. Lucara has completed its analysis of the Sewelô diamond and is considering the next steps for selling the diamond. “The largest diamond recovered in Botswana’s history was named by the people of Botswana this evening in a celebration of Botswana's success,” said Lucara CEO Eira Thomas. “Lucara is proud to share our achievements with all stakeholders in Karowe and the people of Botswana.” The Sewelô is the second-largest diamond ever to be recovered globally and is second in size only to the 3 106 ct Cullinan diamond recovered in South Africa. Karowe also yielded the 1 109 ct Lesedi La Rona diamond in November 2015. That diamond eventually sold for $53-million.
