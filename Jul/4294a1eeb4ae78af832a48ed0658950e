West Africa-focused gold explorer Cora Gold has been awarded 100% ownership of the Tagan permit, located on the Yanfolila gold belt, in Mali. The permit covers 82 km2 of the prospective gold belt and is valid for three years. Tagan is located midway between Cora’s Sanankoro gold discovery and the Yanfolila gold mine, operated by Hummingbird Resources. Historic exploration within the Tagan permit area delivered drill intercepts of 44 m at 1.1 g/t gold and 14 m at 1.7 g/t gold. Cora has identified 20 priority targets for an exploration programme, which may include regional geophysics and shallow reconnaissance drilling. “Initial results from recent fieldwork have indicated potential instances where gold mineralisation has been overlooked by historical work. Analysis of historical data in addition to our own fieldwork has resulted in the identification of 20 priority targets that will form the basis for further exploration work,” confirmed CEO Jon Forster. Meanwhile, the company plans to publish a maiden mineral resource estimate for Sanankoro during the fourth quarter.
