PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Mineral sands developer Strandline Resources has reported an 80% increase in the resource estimate of the Tajiri project, in Tanzania, which is now estimated to host some 268-million tonnes grading 3.3% total heavy minerals. The new resource estimate has increased the contained heavy mineral resources from 4.6-million tonnes to 8.8-million tonnes. Strandline MD Luke Graham said on Tuesday that the Tajiri resource upgrade significantly enhanced the strategic value of Strandline’s mineral sands portfolio and further strengthened the economic outlook for the project. “Tajiri comprises a world-scale series of coherent high-grade titanium-dominated deposits which all start from surface and are situated favourably to the existing infrastructure at Tanga. This last phase of drilling has also confirmed large upside to resources with several deposits remaining open, as well as Strandline recently acquiring prospective tenure along strike to the south of Tajiri.” Graham said that Tajiri’s valuable mineral mix and scalability provided Strandline with a range of development pathways and options for project feasibility, which are now under strategic review.
