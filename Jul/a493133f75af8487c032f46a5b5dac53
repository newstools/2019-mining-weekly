PERTH (miningweekly.com) â€“ Openpit mining has started at the Oposura zinc/lead/silver project, in Mexico, ASX-listed Azure Minerals reported on Friday. The project is expected to produce between 1 500 t/m and 3 000 t/m of ore at grades of between 10% to 15% combined zinc and lead. Ore processing will start in September under a toll treatment agreement with a third-party sulphide flotation processing plant. The small-scale mining operation is focused on exploiting easily-accessible, high-grade, massive sulphide mineralisation from the East Zone mineral resource, with mining to be carried out in two phases. The initial openpit operation will be followed by an underground operation. Azure MD Tony Rovira on Friday said that the operation would allow Azure to realise early cash flow that would help fund the ongoing feasibility study, which would ultimately see Oposura to full-scale production. Openpit mining would continue throughout July and August, with the underground mining contractor expected to mobilise to the site in August to start Phase 2 mining. Azure is targeting full-scale production at Oposura by mid-2021, based on a production rate of 500 000 t/y with an initial six-year mine life. Oposura is expected to produce about 19 000 t/y of zinc, 10 000 t/y of lead and 145 000 oz/y of silver in separate zinc and lead/silver concentrates.
