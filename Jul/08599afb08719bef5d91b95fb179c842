Aim-listed Kavango Resources has received assay results from the two holes drilled at the Ditau Camp prospect, in Botswana, from Genalysis Laboratories in Australia. A total of 489 core samples were prepared by Intertek Laboratories in Johannesburg and assayed for 65 elements by Genalysis using aqua regia digest with Inductively Coupled Plasma finish. Genalysis carried out 12 duplicate check assays, ran 14 control standards and 14 blanks during the assay run. Kavango CEO Michael Foster on Thursday said Kavango was now completing its own check assays at an independent laboratory in South Africa, aligned with normal industry practices. “This will enable the company to be in a position to fully check, assess and interpret the results to formulate its plans for Ditau,” he noted. “Currently, Kavango’s preferred option would be to farm-out this project to an industry partner, mainly due to its size, plus the fact that our main focus remains the Kalahari Suture Zone structure in southwest Botswana, where drilling is expected to commence later this quarter.”
