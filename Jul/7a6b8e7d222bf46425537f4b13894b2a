PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Uranium developer Berkeley Energia has announced the resignation of its MD and CEO Paul Atherley, who has been at the helm since 2015. Atherley’s replacement would likely be a Spanish national, the company said on Thursday, revealing plans to establish a head office in Madrid. Berkeley Energia told shareholders that following on from the successful listing on the Spanish Stock Exchange in 2018, these initiatives were aimed at further enhancing the company’s strong engagement with key stakeholders in Spain. While the recruitment process for a suitable candidate for the MD and CEO position is taking place, nonexecutive director Robert Behets will assume the role of acting MD, with immediate effect, and will be assisted in Spain by Francisco Bellon, the company’s COO. Berkeley Energia said that the company’s focus remained on progressing the approvals required to start construction of its Salamanca project, and bring the mine into production, as well as advancing its recently announced battery and electric vehicle metals exploration strategy.
