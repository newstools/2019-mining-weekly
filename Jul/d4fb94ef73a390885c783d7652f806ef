Aim-listed Kavango Resources has acquired a new prospecting licence (PL) adjacent to its current Ditau PL, in Botswana. The new PL covers an area of 916.4 km2 to the south-west of the current PL. It includes the extensions of the Ditau geological and geophysical structures that have potential for base metals mineralisation. “Extending our land position at Ditau following an assessment of the company’s recent work provides Kavango with an important strategic ground holding in this prospective area,” commented Kavango CEO Michael Foster in a statement issued on Monday. “Additionally, we believe this new licence could be instrumental in the farming-out of this project to an industry partner. This is currently Kavango’s preferred option.” Foster indicated that the company’s main focus remained the Kalahari Suture Zone structure in south-west Botswana where drilling is expected to start later this quarter.
