London-listed copper miner KAZ Minerals on Thursday attributed the 11% quarter-on-quarter increase in its second-quarter production to increased concentrator availability and efficient operations across the group’s mines in Kazakhstan, Russia and Kyrgyzstan. Copper production rose to 147 600 t, which is also a 6% improvement on that of the same quarter last year. The Aktogay mine delivered record output of 37 400 t, the East Region and Bozymchak operations lifted output to 16 900 t, while the Boszhakol mine’s output dropped to 47 100 t, but the clay plant returned to full capacity. KAZ also produced 12 200 t of zinc in concentrate, 44 300 oz of gold and 926 000 oz of silver. CEO Andrew Southam said in a statement that the company was well positioned to achieve its 2019 copper guidance of 300 000 t.
