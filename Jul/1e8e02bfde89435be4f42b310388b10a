BENGALURU â€“ Glencore on Thursday confirmed Democratic Republic of Congo armed forces were in the area around a copper and cobalt mine run by the company, a week after a landslide there killed 43 miners. Congolese security forces began evicting illegal miners from the mine on Thursday, local activists said. Glencore said the armed forces' presence follows a growing presence of "illegal" artisanal miners throughout industrial mining concessions in the Kolwezi area.
