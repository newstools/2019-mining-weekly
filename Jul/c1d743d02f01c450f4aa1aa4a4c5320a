PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Dual-listed gold miner OceanaGold on Wednesday told shareholders that there has been a delay in its application for an injunction against the unauthorised restraint of its Didipio operations, in the Philippines. The ASX- and TSX-listed miner last week filed for an injunction against the local government of Nueva Vizcaya, after the governor directed local government units to "restrain any operations" of OceanaGold. The miner on Wednesday noted that the injunction hearing had been rescheduled for July 12, following a scheduling conflict, with the company anticipating a decision to be handed down in a "timely" manner. OceanaGold said that it had attempted to engage with the provincial government to resolve their current position, but had been forced to file the injunction to ensure that the local government unit recognised the legitimacy of Didipio’s continued right to operate, and the national government’s legal authority over the operation.
