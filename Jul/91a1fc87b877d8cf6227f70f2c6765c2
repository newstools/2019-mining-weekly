PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Australian gold major Evolution Mining has reported an increase in gold production during the June quarter, compared with the previous quarter, as nearly all of the miner’s operations increased production. Gold production during the three months to June reached 194 886 oz, up from the 175 901 oz produced in the March quarter, bringing full year production to 753 001 oz. Full-year production was well within the guidance of between 720 000 oz and 770 000 oz. Silver production for the quarter was also reported at 184 693 oz, while copper production reached 5 648 t. Production at the Cowal mine, in New South Wales, increased from 64 117 oz to 67 878 oz in the quarter under review, driven by increased throughput rates, while the Mungari mine, in Western Australia, increased production from 24 966 oz in the March quarter, to 30 457 oz, on the back of increased availability of high-grade ore. In Queensland, the Mt Carlton mine increased production from 26 116 oz to 28 232 oz, while Mt Rawdon production increased from 20 124 oz to 24 404 oz in the same period. Evolution’s interest in the Ernest Henry project delivered 25 820 oz of gold, up from the 22 419 oz in the previous quarter, while production from Cracow remained relatively stable at 18 095 oz. During the June quarter, Evolution sold 190 810 oz of gold at an average price of A$1 858/oz, with mine operating cash flows reported at A$215.2-million during the quarter, and net mine cash flow at A$152.2-million. C1 cash costs for the period declined from A$681/oz to A$579/oz, while all-in sustaining costs (AISC) declined from A$925/oz to A$915/oz.
