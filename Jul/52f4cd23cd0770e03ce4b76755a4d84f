PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Junior Ark Mines has formed a tentative joint venture (JV) to facilitate gold production from its tenements in the Northern Territory. The company on Tuesday announced that it had agreed, in principle, to terms for a JV with Trendsheer Holdings and ICA Mining Services to mine and produce gold dore in the Northern Territory. Trendsheer holds an approved mining management plan that allows the company to mine iron-ore on its tenement adjacent to Ark’s own Mt Porter and Frances Creek projects. The JV agreement contemplates that Trendsheer’s current mining management plan would be modified to permit the establishment and operation of a gold processing plant. Ark said on Wednesday that this process was not expected to be too delayed, considering that the tenements were currently permitted for iron-ore mining.
