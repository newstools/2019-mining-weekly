PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Diversified miner Rio Tinto has completed the sale of its interest in the Rössing uranium mine, in Namibia, to China National Uranium Corporation (CNUC). The two companies in November last year struck an agreement under which Rio would divest of its 68.62% stake in the project in exchange for $106.5-million in cash. Rio has now received an initial $6.5-million cash payment with the remaining $100-million contingent payment linked to uranium spot prices and Rössing's net income during the next seven calendar years. In addition, Rio will receive a cash payment if CNUC sells the Zelda 20 mineral deposit during a restricted period following completion. “This sale demonstrates Rio Tinto’s commitment to further simplifying and strengthening our portfolio and brings the total divestment proceeds received since 2017 to $11.2-billion, of which $9.7-billion has been returned to our shareholders,” CEO Jean-Sebastian Jacques said on Tuesday. “I would like to recognise the hard work of people across Rio Tinto and the communities around Rössing who have contributed to the success of the mine and wish them all the best for the future under new ownership.” The openpit Rössing mine has been operational since 1976 and in 2017 produced 4.6-million pounds of uranium, of which Rio’s share was 3.19-million pounds.
