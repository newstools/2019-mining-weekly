JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) – Mineral Resources and Energy Deputy Minister Bavelile Hlongwa on Wednesday said a discussion to review Mining Charter III “would be very relevant”, given the current iteration’s lack of an explicit provision for youth ownership. Speaking during the Department of Mineral Resources’ Budget Vote speech, in the National Assembly, she stated that there should be more of a balance between, “the knowledge of the old guard and the innovation of the youth” for the advancement of the industry and, therefore, also the country. Hlongwa, who was previously executive deputy chairperson of the National Youth Development Agency, added that it would remain difficult for the old guard to fully comprehend, adopt and adapt to the Fourth Industrial Revolution and, as such, youth ownership in mining companies would be instrumental to their functioning as modern and sustainable operations. She called for the youth to form part of the community groupings and black economic empowerment entrepreneurs working with the department and mining companies to become shareholders in mining companies. Meanwhile, seemingly in response to Democratic Alliance Shadow Minister of Minerals and Energy Kevin Mileham’s suggestion that the government scrap the Mining Charter in its entirety, Hlongwa stated that, “If we were to mine and not have a policy position to ensure the inclusion of all previously marginalised groups . . . we would be cutting and pasting from the Apartheid system.”
