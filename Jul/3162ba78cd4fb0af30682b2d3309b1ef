PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Argosy Minerals has started lithium carbonate production at its industrial-scale pilot plant at the Rincon project, in Argentina. The operation entails the continuous processing of concentrated lithium brine, which is sourced from the operational evaporation ponds at the Rincon project area using Argosy’s proprietary and exclusive chemical process to produce a 99.5% lithium carbonate product. The lithium carbonate being produced will be stored until it is ready for shipment under a sales agreement struck in March. “We are at a distinct advantage to our peers, having successfully proven our chemical processing capability in producing 99.5% lithium carbonate product and secured a reputable international customer to purchase our product,” said Argosy MD Jerko Zuvela. “We are excited to continue progressing with our fast-track development strategy toward commercial-scale production.” Argosy is working towards a 2 000 t/y modular operation as the next step in the ramp-up of operations. Regulatory approvals for this stage of the work are still outstanding.
