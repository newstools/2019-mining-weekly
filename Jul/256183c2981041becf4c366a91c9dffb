PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The first gold ore from the Red October mine, in Western Australia, has been hauled to AngloGold Ashanti’s Sunrise Dam gold treatment plant. Junior Matsa Resources’ executive chairperson Paul Poli on Friday said that the delivery of first ore from Red October was another significant milestone for both Matsa and its shareholders. “It is expected that this will be the start of regular, continued ore deliveries to Sunrise Dam for the foreseeable future, generating a regular income stream in the process.” Matsa and AngloGold Ashanti struck a five-year ore purchase agreement under which ore from the Red October mine will be proceed at AngloGold Ashanti’s 3.8-million-tonne-a-year mill at the Sunrise Dam project. Matsa will be responsible for mining and transporting the ore to the Sunrise Dam operation, some 60 km from the Red October mine, with AngloGold Ashanti taking possession of the ore once delivered.
