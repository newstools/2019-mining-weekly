TSX-listed Ivanhoe Mines has extended the strike length of its massive copper sulphide mineralisation at the Kamoa-Kakula mining licence in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The company’s drilling has extended the strike length of the shallow, thick copper discovery at the Kamoa North Bonanza zone by 200 m to at least 550 m, with an implied strike length of at least 2.7 km and a width of up to 60 m across strike. Additionally, new assays have returned copper grades of up to 13.8% over 15.5 m in the central discovery area. The company now has six rigs operating at Kamoa North to extend the strike length further and fast-track a resource estimate. Meanwhile, drilling on Ivanhoe’s wholly-owned Western Foreland licences, which are north of the Kamoa-Kakula mining licence, has resulted in the discovery of the extension of the Kamoa Far North high-grade shallow copper corridor in Ivanhoe’s licences for at least 400 m.
