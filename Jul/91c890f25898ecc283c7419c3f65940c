Russian diamond company Alrosa earned revenue of $10.3-million in its latest auction of special size rough diamonds weighing more than 10.8 ct, in Hong Kong. It sold 112 gem-quality rough diamonds with a total weight of 1 910 ct. Buyers from Hong Kong, India, Israel, Belgium, the United Arab Emirates and Russia participated in the auction. "Despite the challenging situation in the diamond market today, the good results of the past auction confirm the Asian market has a stable interest in our products,” Alrosa United Selling Organization director and executive committee member Evgeny Agureev said. “Hong Kong is one of the most important centres of international diamond trade, so we regularly organise rough diamond sales here. The next auction will be held on the sidelines of the Hong Kong Jewellery & Gem Fair in September. “During the fair, we also plan to hold the second True Colours auction for coloured polished diamonds,” Agureev added. Alrosa scheduled three international auctions in Hong Kong for this year, with total revenues of $20-million having been generated for the first two auctions.
