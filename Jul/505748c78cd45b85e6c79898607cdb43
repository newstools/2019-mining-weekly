PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Junior gold developer Beacon Minerals is targeting full production at its Juardie gold project, in Western Australia, by the fourth quarter of this year. The ASX-listed company on Thursday said an initial throughput had been targeted at a rate of 500 000 t/y to deliver some 25 000 oz/y of gold. Commissioning of the Juardi gold project is progressing apace, with a 6 MW power station having been commissioned and supplying baseload power to the mill. The plant compressor has also be installed and testing of this has started. Commissioning and production ramp-up is expected to continue through August and September this year, Beacon said on Friday. “The ongoing progress at Juardi is on track for full production, which is expected in the fourth quarter,” MD Graham McGarry told shareholders. “That the Australian dollar price is currently in excess of A$2 000/oz, when compared to the gold price of A$1 650/oz used in the prefeasibility study, is very positive for the project and will only increase the company’s success and shareholder value.”
