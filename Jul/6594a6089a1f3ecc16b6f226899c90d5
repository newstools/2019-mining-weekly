US metallurgical coal miner Corsa Coal announced on Tuesday that CEO George Dethlefsen would step down from his position on July 12, to pursue other opportunities. The company, which trades on the TSX-V, said in a media statement that Dethlefsen's departure was not the result of any dispute or disagreement with the company or any matter related to the operations, policies, management or board of directors. Peter Merritts, the company's current president of the Northern Appalachia division, would take over from Dethlefsen as CEO and a director of the company. Corsa said that Merritts had been responsible for its metallurgical coal operations in Pennsylvania and Maryland since February 2015, and that he had more than 40 years of experience in the coal industry, including as president of the Pennsylvania-based AMFIRE Mining, a former subsidiary of Alpha Natural Resources, and leadership positions at Mapco Coal, now Alliance Resource Partners, and Bethlehem Steel.
