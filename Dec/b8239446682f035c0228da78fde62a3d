The ore reserve estimate for Finnish mining company Keliber’s Rapasaari lithium deposit has been updated and estimated proven and probable ore reserves now total more than 5.2-million tonnes, 49.6% more than previously estimated. The new Joint Ore Reserves Committee 2012 compliant ore reserve estimate for the deposit includes the openpit and underground ore reserves. In addition to the almost 50% increase in the total ore reserves of the deposit, the estimate includes reserves for the category of proven ore reserves in total of 1.4-million tonnes with an average grade of 1.07% lithium oxide (Li₂O). The total Joint Ore Reserves Committee 2012 compliant total proven and probable ore reserves for the company, using a cutoff grade of 0.40% Li₂O for the openpit ore reserves and a cutoff grade of between 0.4% and 0.7% Li₂O for the underground ore reserves are just more than 9.3-million tonnes with a grade of 0.98% Li₂O. Commenting on the increase, CEO Pertti Lamberg said the Rapasaari deposit was an important target and said that the company would continue its drilling programme on the Rapasaari deposit itself, as well as in its immediate vicinity. “We estimate that the positive development in the Rapasaari ore reserve estimate and earlier in Syväjärvi ore reserve estimate, will extend the operating time of our own ores to [about] sixteen years,” Lamberg said.
