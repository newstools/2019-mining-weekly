The Competition Tribunal has unconditionally approved diversified miner Exxaro Resources' proposed buyout of the remaining 50% interest in the Cennergi joint venture (JV). Exxaro in September announced the proposed R1.55-billion transaction to buy out Khopoli Investments' share in the JV, which owns the 134 MW Amakhala Emoyeni Wind Farm and the 95 MW Tsitsikamma Community Wind Farm in the Eastern Cape. The deal will give Exxaro, which owns and controls coal, base metals, ferrous and energy assets, 100% ownership of Cennergi. The tribunal says the transaction presents no competition or public interest concerns.
