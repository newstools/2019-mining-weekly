Aim-listed Firestone Diamonds has confirmed that stable grid power has been restored at its Liqhobong diamond mine, in Lesotho, and that the mine is processing at full capacity. The Lesotho Electricity Company-owned Muela hydropower station was brought back into operation on December 1, following a two-month shutdown period for maintenance. Firestone had to stall its processing plant operation from October 1 to October 26, when diesel generators were commissioned. The plant then operated at between 80% and 90% capacity throughout November. The company had to spend an additional $1.1-million on renting the generators while grid power was restored.
