Gold mining major Harmony Gold has been hit by an attempted armed robbery at its Kalgold plant, in the North West, in the early hours of Friday morning. The JSE-listed firm said that a reaction unit superviser, employed by a contracted security company, was fatally wounded in the attack. No gold was stolen. Harmony extended its condolences to the bereaved and said that the matter was now the subject of a police investigation. South Africa’s gold industry is reeling under an increased number of attacks by heavily armed gunmen at their processing plants, looking for easy and lucrative access to the metal. The industry has for years struggled with illegal miners, but according to an article in financial daily newspaper Business Day, the narrative over the past year has taken on a new and more sinister tone, with gangs armed with AK-47s and other automatic rifles to attack plants to steal concentrate or smelted gold. In October, a gang of about 16 to 20 men armed with automatic rifles took 11 company employees hostage at DRDGold’s Ergo operation near Brakpan, east of Johannesburg, to gain access to the gold plant. DRDGold chief security officer Bart Coetzee was shot dead, and the gang escaped with 17 kg of gold in concentrate worth about R12-million. Sibanye-Stillwater has also been raided over the past year, but according to the newspaper, the gang was driven away by security after a fierce gun battle.
