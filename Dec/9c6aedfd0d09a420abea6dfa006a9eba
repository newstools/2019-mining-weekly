PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Heron Resources has processed its first high-grade underground ore from its Woodlawn project, in New South Wales. The junior on Thursday said that ore from the high-grade G2 lens was mined to 135 m below surface. “The first ore mined and now processed from the G2 lens is a significant achievement for the operations at Woodlawn. The high-grade G2 lens was planned to be the first underground ore through the plant and will generate early revenues in these first stages of underground mining,” said Heron chairperson Stephen Dennis. Ore processing at the Woodlawn project started in May this year, and at steady state, the project is expected to produce 70 000 t/y of zinc concentrates, 30 000 t/y of copper concentrates and 25 000 t/y of lead concentrates. The first stages of commissioning were completed using tailings reclaim feed material, with some preliminary commissioning of the crushing and ball mill plant during August and September. The plant was now receiving run-of-mine underground ore, and will complete a campaign solely on this feed source, facilitating the next phase of commissioning for the crusher and ball mill, marking the start of the ramp-up phase for this part of the circuit. In steady-state, the plant will alternate between campaigns of tailings reclaim feed and underground ore.
