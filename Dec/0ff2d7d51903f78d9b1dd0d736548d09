A fall-of-ground incident on Friday afternoon resulted in the death of four employees at Village Main Reef’s Tau Lekoa gold mine, in North West. The employees’ bodies were discovered following a rescue operation over the weekend. The rescue team managed to save a fifth worker, who is in a stable condition in hospital. Village Main Reef said the fall-of-ground incident happened following seismic events at the mine on Friday afternoon. The Department of Mineral Resources and Energy (DMRE) implored employers and workers to continue prioritising health and safety at the mines. ”We pay tribute to all of those who pursued the rescue efforts around the clock since Friday in difficult and hazardous conditions; to the unions and mine management for spearheading the rescue effort; and to the DMRE for its support. “The industry is intent on eliminating workplace fatalities, in line with the goal of the Minerals Council’s Khumbul'ekhaya campaign launched earlier this year,” Minerals Council South Africa CEO Roger Baxter stated.
