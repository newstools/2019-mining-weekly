The company confirmed on Wednesday that the various work streams have completed and are currently under final review by multidisciplinary engineering, environmental and mining consultancy Wardell Armstrong International. The scoping study was done in an effort to understand the project’s potential to be a standalone oxide mining operation. Cora CEO Jonathan Forster said on Wednesday that the company remains confident that the initial scoping study will demonstrate the project’s potential to be a standalone oxide mining operation.
