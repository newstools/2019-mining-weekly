PERTH (miningweekly.com) â€“ Nickel miner Western Areas has resumed normal operations at its Forrestania project, in Western Australia, following a bush fire. The miner on Thursday last week temporarily suspended operations at Forrestania following a bush fire incident, which was likely started by a lightning strike. Western Areas on Monday noted that while the mains power was interrupted over the weekend, as a result of damage to three power lines, it was restored by the end of the weekend, with mining operations continuing on site using back-up power generation. Operations at the Cosmic Boy mill were suspended until the power transmission was restored; however, Western Areas said that there was likely to be no impact to nickel production or cost guidance for the 2020 financial year.
