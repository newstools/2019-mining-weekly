Canadian junior explorer Giyani Metals Corporation has selected Botswana-based minerals processing services company Lazenby Holdings to undertake the environmental cleanup work at its K.Hill and Otse manganese deposits. This is in accordance with the environmental management plans (EMPs) which were approved by Botswana's Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA) in July this year. TSX-V- and Frankfurt-listed Giyani will now negotiate the final contract documents with Lazenby. It is also continuing with discussions with Traxys regarding a convertible loan note to fund the reclamation work. “We are very satisfied with the final proposal from Lazenby; they have demonstrated high levels of innovation and flexibility which enabled us to achieve our intended deliverables within the forecast budget. "We look forward to working jointly with Lazenby towards final contracts and a smooth execution of this project which will add value to our shareholders and establish Giyani as a credible mineral resource developer in Botswana,” Giyani CEO Robin Birchall comments. Lazenby CEO Casper Groenewald says the company is excited to have been awarded the tender and is confident that its extensive operating experience in Botswana will ensure the success of the project.
