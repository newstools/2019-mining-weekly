This licence covers 16 126 ha and is valid until May 2044, with a 25-year extension option. The licence is the second of three contiguous concessions to be issued that will result in the full tenement permitting of the project. The first licence covers 11 948 ha of prospective land and is valid to April 2044, also with a 25-year extension option. The Mutamba tenement contains an indicated and inferred mineral resources of 4.4-billion tonnes, grading 3.9% total heavy minerals.
