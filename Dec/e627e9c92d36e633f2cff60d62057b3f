PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Gold miner Perseus Mining has awarded a mining services contract to EPSA Internacional SA at its Yaouré gold mine in Cote d’Ivoire. The contract will run for a period of 65 months starting on November 1 next year, and would see the movement of some 170-million tonnes of material, including 27-million tonnes of ore containing more than 1.5-million ounces of gold. EPSA is expected to start mobilising equipment to site in March of next year. “The award of the Yaouré mining contract to EPSA is yet another important milestone on the path to bringing the Yaouré gold mine into production. We are delighted to be working with EPSA, an international mining company of true substance, whose client list currently includes major gold mining companies such as Newmont, Agnico Eagle and Yamana Gold,” said Perseus MD and CEO Jeff Quartermaine. He noted that in addition to offering a competitive price, EPSA also had equipment available for immediate mobilization, and had a proven record of establishing greenfield mining sites in jurisdictions where employment and training of personnel from local catchment communities was a priority. Perseus earlier this week signed a Mining Convention for its Yaouré with the Ivorian government. The $265-million Yaouré project is expected to become a large-scale, low-cost gold mining operation producing an average of 215 000 oz/y over the first five years of its mine life, with first gold targeted in December 2020.
