Professional engineer Tony Makuch, the CEO of gold miner Kirkland Lake, has joined the board of developer Wallbridge Mining. Kirkland Lake recently became a 9.9% shareholder of Wallbridge pursuant to a private placement financing. "Tony's extensive experience in operations, resource development, capital markets and M&A [mergers and acquisitions] will be very beneficial to all shareholders as we advance Fenelon toward production,” commented Wallbridge chairperson Alan Soever. In connection with the offering, Wallbridge on Friday entered into an agreement with Kirkland Lake, granting the company certain anti-dilution rights and the right to nominate one director to the board. The Fenelon property is located proximal to the Sunday Lake Deformation Zone, an emerging gold belt in north-western Quebec with an ongoing 70 000 m to 80 000 m exploration drill programme.
