Aim-listed Cora Gold has declared a maiden inferred mineral resource estimate of five-million tonnes, at 1.6 g/t gold, for 265 000 oz of gold at its Sanonkora project, in southern Mali. The pit constrained maiden resource estimate was compiled by consultants SRK Consulting, and is an initial step in determining the overall potential of Sanankoro, which has a one-million- to two-million-ounce exploration target within 100 m of surface. "We are pleased to announce the initial mineral resource estimate for Sanankoro, which was focused on the oxide starter pit potential of the project. This estimate is the first step in defining the overall oxide potential at the project, where, to date, less than a quarter of the exploration target has been tested. "We have also been able to include a small amount of sulphide material in the mineral resource estimate, confirming our belief that exploration expansion into the sulphide zones could provide significant future upside," comments CEO Jonathan Forster. He adds that Cora remains on track to deliver an initial scoping study, which will assist in derisking the project by establishing the framework for understanding the economics of a future mine development and also provide guidance for the ongoing exploration programmes to maximise the delineation of further economic mineralisation, during this quarter.
