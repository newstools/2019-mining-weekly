The Minerals Council South Africa has launched its social and labor plan (SLP) portal where members can post their SLP documentation so it can be easily accessed by interested parties. While company participation is voluntary, the Minerals Council on Wednesday reiterated its belief that approved SLPs, and companiesâ€™ annual compliance reports to the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy, should be made available for public scrutiny. Regulation 42 to the Minerals and Petroleum Resources Development Act requires companies to submit an SLP to the department as a pre-requisite for the granting of a mining right. SLPs, which are considered to be instruments for achieving transformation in terms of the Mining Charter, are normally required to be revised and resubmitted every five years throughout the life of a mining right.
