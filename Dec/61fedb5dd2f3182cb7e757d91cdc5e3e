PERTH (miningweekly.com) â€“ A scoping study into the Crown Prince gold project, in Western Australia, has estimated that it could produce some 22 444 oz of gold over an 18-month period. ASX-listed Ora Gold on Wednesday reported that the project is likely to require a capital input of around A$4.7-million to develop, including project working capital, which would be fully funded through a combination of equity, loan and project participation. While an initial openpit operation is being considered for the Crown Prince project, Ora said that mining could proceed to an underground operation, depending on exploration results at the project area. Between 1908 and 1915, Crown Prince was partially developed along two veins and produced 20 178 oz of gold at recovered grades of 21.7 g/t gold. The project is currently estimated to host a total resource of 479 000 t, grading 3.9 g/t gold for 56 000 oz.
