Canadian royalty and streaming company Triple Flag Precious Metals on Wednesday pulled a planned initial public offering, citing a difficult market environment for new share offerings. Toronto-based Triple Flag, backed by hedge fund Elliot Management Corp, had said it expected to price at C$15 to C$18 a share, and raise up to C$360-million. The company, led by a former Barrick Gold executive, provides up-front financing to miners in exchange for future revenue or a share of production. In a statement, it said it had been encouraged by investor interest but that the market environment for share offerings "continues to be challenging." Triple Flag holds royalty interests in Alamos Gold's Young-Davidson mine in the Canadian province of Ontario and Kirkland Lake Gold's Fosterville underground mine in Australia. Lead underwriters for the offering included Bank of America Securities, CIBC World Markets and Scotia Capital.
