TSX-V-listed Golden Predator has appointed Mike Maslowski as its COO to lead the development team in charge of advancing the Brewery Creek mine, in Yukon, Canada. He served as COO of Golden Predator from 2011 to 2014 and the company believes that his familiarity with the project will enable it to advance quickly, once a production decision has been made. Maslowski will coordinate and manage all the company's construction and mine development activities at Brewery Creek. In addition, he will oversee the continuing expansion of the project through aggressive mine site exploration, environmental studies, permitting and future development. "With Mike now in the position of COO we have completed our mine development team and have the right people in place to advance projects like Brewery Creek into development and operations," said CEO Janet Lee-Sheriff. Maslowski previously worked with Golden Predator from 2011 to 2014 as VP of exploration and then COO, expanding the Brewery Creek heap leach recoverable oxide resource more than five-fold in three years and directing the Brewery Creek preliminary economic assessment study of 2014. Since 2017 he has been the technical services superintendent for Teck Washington at their Pend Oreille mine, an underground lead/zinc mine. Prior to 2011, he was with Coeur dâ€™Alene Mines for ten years in numerous positions.
