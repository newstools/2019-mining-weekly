PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed FYI Resources has secured an industrial site in the Kwinana industrial area for its high purity alumina (HPA) refining facility to refine kaolin feedstock from its Cadoux project. MD Roland Hill on Wednesday said that the Kwinana industrial area was a world-class industrial hub, adding that the company was delighted to be selected as a proponent within the zone and a participant in the Battery Valley. “Having our HPA refinery located in this zone is a real asset to the company and is integral to our fully integrated production strategy. The benefit of being located in the Kwinana industrial area brings many tangible and intangible benefits to our business model such as essential services, utilities and suppliers at our doorstep, permitting and cost benefits, proximity to Perth and the advantages of a centralized distribution and export hub.” FYI recently reported grades of 99.99% at its HPA pilot plant, which was operated continuously from October 2 to 9 on a 24/7 basis, and either met or exceeded the modelled operational performances, demonstrating the potential for commercial production of HPA.
