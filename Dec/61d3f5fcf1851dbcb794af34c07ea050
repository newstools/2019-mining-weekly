Nuclear power company Kazatomprom bid farewell to independent board member Jon Dudas, who had been serving since 2015, and stepped down on Friday, December 6. Dudas, who had also been serving as chairperson of the company’s board of directors since August 2018, has been offered a position on the board of directors of the Samruk Kazyna Sovereign Wealth Fund, Kazatomprom’s majority shareholder. “As a nuclear industry leader that has weathered difficult marketing conditions, the focus on sustainable value has always been accompanied by an unwavering emphasis on strong health, safety and environmental programmes, and transparent governance – all crucial components of any international company in the global capital marketplace,” Dudas said. The board unanimously elected Neil Longfellow as interim board chairperson until shareholders elect the board chairperson at the next general meeting of Kazatomprom shareholders. Additionally, an international process to identify additional independent, nonexecutive board members is now under way, following which the board will propose additional board members from selected candidates at the company's annual general meeting in May, 2020. Longfellow currently sits on all board committees, as is the case for each of Kazatomprom's independent board members, and is chairman of the production safety committee. "With the core task of privatisation now behind us, I look forward to working with the board and Kazatomprom's management team to build on that success, and continue to focus on long-term value for our stakeholders,” he commented.
