Aim-listed Metal Tiger’s 2019 Okavango copper project (OCP) drilling programme has been completed, with six holes successfully proving the presence of D’Kar Formation (DKF) and Ngwako Pan Formation (NPF) stratigraphy. The DKF-NPF contact hosts prospective copper and silver mineralisation, Metal Tiger confirmed on Friday. The Botswana Department of Environmental Affairs has also authorised the start of exploration activities, including drilling at Kitlanya West (KIT-W) and Kitlanya East (KIT-E). Gazetting of the required environmental management plans has been completed and drilling is planned to start testing structural targets at KIT-E, 5 km from the T3 Deposit (which is 100% owned by Sandfire Resources) and its planned processing plant, in early 2020. Seven compelling drill targets have also been identified from coincident regional soil sampling and airborne electromagnetic geophysics results in the KIT-W area. Metal Tiger CEO Michael McNeilly on Friday said the company was “encouraged to report” the intersection of wide zones of copper mineralisation from diamond drilling at the Okavango copper project, in Botswana. The company is still awaiting core assays on the presence of trace copper sulphides, over a total interval of about 85 m, which may represent a mineralised halo to potentially higher-grade copper mineralisation nearby. OCP, KIT-W and KIT-E are owned by Kalahari Metals, in which Metal Tiger has a 59.81% interest.
