PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The definitive feasibility study for the Toliara mineral sands project, in Madagascar, is due for completion by December this year, ASX-listed Base Resources said on Wednesday. Speaking at the Paydirt Africa Downunder conference, in Perth, Base MD Tim Carstens noted that a final investment decision on the project was expected by early to mid-2020, allowing for first production in 2022. A previously completed prefeasibility study (PFS) into Toliara estimated that the project could produce some 37.1-million tonnes of heavy mineral concentrate over a life-of-mine of 33 years. The PFS envisaged a two-stage development option, with the Stage 1 operation estimated to cost $439-million to develop a 13-million-tonne-a-year operation, while the Stage 2 operation would expand production to 19-million tonnes a year, for an additional cost of $67-million. Toliara is expected to deliver annual average production of 806 000 t of ilmenite, 54 000 t/y of zircon and 8 000 t/y of rutile. “We are currently establishing early capability and capacity building programmes at Toliara, advancing land acquisition and initiating the debt funding process,” Carstens said on Wednesday. “This is a truly world-class mineral sands development project with a long mine life.”
