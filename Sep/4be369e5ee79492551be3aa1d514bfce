PERTH (miningweekly.com) – An additional 40-million tonnes a year of capacity has been made available at the port of Port Hedland, increasing the annual shipping capacity to 617-million tonnes. Western Australian Ports Minister Alannah MacTiernan noted that the annual capacity allocations for current port users will remain the same, however, the increased capacity will allow all port users more capacity above their allocated tonnages by accessing D‑class shipping opportunities under the Port Hedland Vessel Movement Protocols. “The additional capacity is the result of ongoing investment in world-leading port innovations and technology and provides port users more opportunities to maximise the amount of product they ship through Port Hedland,” she said. “Providing this extra capacity will give industry the confidence to continue to invest in the Pilbara's resources sector, helping to drive regional jobs, trade and royalties that benefit all Western Australians.” The new capacity modelling by Pilbara Ports Authority was a result of state government and industry investment at the port including capital dredging, innovative marine technology and other port efficiencies. This includes the recently completed three-year dredging works programme, the Channel Risk and Optimisation Project. The A$120-million project included the removal of 'high spots' in the channel, optimising navigable depths to allow deeper drafted vessels to safely navigate along the 42 km shipping channel. Also driving this increase is the continued movement and facilitation of larger vessels in the channel. The sizes of ships coming into Port Hedland have increased significantly in recent years, with 45% of vessels now carrying more than 200 000 deadweight tonnage, compared to less than 10% in 2009.
