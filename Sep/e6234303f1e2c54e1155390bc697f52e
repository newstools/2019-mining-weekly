Dominic Barton has resigned from the board of directors of Vancouver-headquartered miner Teck Resources to assume the role of Canada’s Ambassador to China. Barton joined Teck’s board in September last year and was appointed chairperson on October 1. Sheila Murray, chairperson of Teck’s corporate governance and nominating committee, will assume the role of acting board chairperson. Teck extended its congratulations to Barton on his new appointment. “His depth of experience and global perspective make him uniquely qualified to assist Canada in continuing to build its relationship with China.” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau named Barton as his ambassador to Beijing on Wednesday. The post had been vacant since the beginning of the year, when the previous envoy was forced to resign after making controversial statements about the extradition case of a top Chinese executive.
