ASX-listed Bardoc Gold has taken another step towards its objective of building a significant midtier Australian gold company after delivering a substantial increase in the mineral resource for its 100%-owned Bardoc gold project, in Western Australia, to more than three-million ounces. The updated project-wide measured, indicated and inferred mineral resource now stands at 49.4-million tonnes at 1.9 g/t gold for just over three-million ounces of contained gold. The updated mineral resource estimate (MRE) contains 42.2-million tonnes at 1.5 g/t gold for about two-million ounces classified as being potentially open pittable and 7.2-million tonnes at 4.1 g/t gold for 962 000 oz that may be amenable to underground mining methods. The updated resource base of three-million ounces is available for mining studies as part of the prefeasibility study currently under way and due for completion in the first quarter of 2020. Bardoc CEO Robert Ryan commented that while there had been a significant increase in resource ounces across a number of deposits, the growth in the Zoroastrian underground resource of more than 80 000 oz was “particularly notable”, as this would provide strong support for future underground mining operations. It is also expected to be an important source of free-milling ore to the consolidated Bardoc gold project. Further, following the recently completed capital raising, the company has already restarted drilling with a view to further expanding its mineral resources and upgrading inferred resources to measured and indicated status. Follow-up drilling is currently under way at El Dorado and the company looks forward to drill-testing the recently acquired North Kanowna Star, Mayday and Vettersburg projects.
