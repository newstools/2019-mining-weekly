Dual-listed Bluejay Mining has formally lodged its exploitation licence application for the Dundas ilmenite project with the mineral licence and safety authority of Greenland. The exploitation licence covers the onshore portion of Dundas and once approved will allow the company to take the next step toward production of 440 000 t/y. Currently, the defined mineral resource at Dundas stands at 117-million tonnes at 6.1% ilmenite at a 0% cutoff grade, as well as a maiden offshore exploration target of between 300-million tonnes and 530-million tonnes of ilmenite at an average expected grade range of 0.4% to 4.8% ilmenite. “Needless to say, we are thrilled to have lodged our exploitation licence application over the onshore parts of the Dundas project area, this achievement signals the accomplishment of over three years of work and is yet another significant milestone for Bluejay,” says CEO Roderick McIllree. The company recently shipped its first bulk sample from Greenland to Rio Tinto in Canada.
