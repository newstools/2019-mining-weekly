Embattled diamond miner Stornoway Diamond Corp has been informed that it will be delisted from the TSX at the close of market on October 18. The company, which operates the Renard mine, in Quebec, was granted credit protection earlier this month to restructure its business and financial affairs. Stornoway said on Wednesday that it would not appeal the delisting decision and that it no longer intended to file continuous disclosure documents under the corporationâ€™s profile on the System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval (www.sedar.ca). Mining royalty and streaming company Osisko Gold Royalties earlier this month entered into a letter of intent to form an entity to acquire Stornoway.
