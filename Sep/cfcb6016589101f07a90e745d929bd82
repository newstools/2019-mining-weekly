Project developers have welcomed this week’s Constitutional Court ruling in Ecuador that dismissed a petition to seek local consultation to consider prohibiting mining activities in Azuay province. The court concluded that referendums implying constitutional reforms were incompatible with the Ecuadorian constitution. Further, it ruled that any referendum which could result in other nationally enjoyed constitutional rights being restricted, were inadmissible. The petition was also found to be too broad and the court said it did not comply with legal requirements for its admission. “This decision, in conjunction with the previously rejected petition of a similar nature in the Imbabura province in northern Ecuador, sets a strong precedent for any future petitions for consultation to consider changes to the constitution of Ecuador,” said LSE- and TSX-listed SolGold in a media statement on Thursday. Azuay province is home to several mining projects, including SolGold’s 100%-owned Sharug project, a high priority project that the copper miner believes has considerable potential for the discovery of a world-class orebody. Canada’s INV Metals’ Loma Larga project is also located in Azuay. The company said on Wednesday that it would start its financing and permitting efforts within the laws and regulations of Ecuador with the support from stakeholders, the government, and the mining industry. “Loma Larga is one of five strategic mining projects identified by the Ministry of Energy and Nonrenewable Resources.”
