PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed junior Canyon Resources has reported a 62% increase in the mineral resources at its Martap bauxite project, in Cameroon. The project is now estimated to host a 892-million-tonne resource, grading 45.1% aluminium oxide and 2.8% silicon dioxide, while the total indicated mineral resource has increased by 850% to 839-million tonnes. “Upgrading the Minim Martap resource to nearly 900-million tonnes of high-grade, low contaminant bauxite confirms the Minim Martap project as a global tier one bauxite asset,” said Canyon MD Phillip Gallagher. “The bauxite is proven to be very gibbsite-rich, with negligible boehmite, making it suitable for use in both high and low temperature alumina refineries.” Gallagher said that the resource upgrade now placed Canyon in a stronger position to negotiate offtake deals and to start discussions with third parties to advance project development. A feasibility study for the Martap project is currently under way.
