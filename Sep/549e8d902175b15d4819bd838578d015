Dennis Fentie, who was a director of TSX-V-listed Golden Predator Mining until his resignation two weeks ago, passed away on August 29, having lost his battle with cancer. Fentie, who was a former Yukon Premier, was a “passionate advocate" for the Yukon mining industry, Golden Predator executive chairperson William Sheriff said on Tuesday. “A tireless leader, Dennis fully embraced our agenda to meaningfully contribute to community development and expansion of the Yukon’s mining sector as we build a strong company for our shareholders. We are a stronger and better company due in large part to his influence and our hearts go out to Lorraine, his family and friends at this time." Sherrif said that Fentie's life was to be celebrated. "His unparalleled contributions to the Yukon and our company have left a legacy for the future.” Yukon Premier Sandy Silver has said that Fentie’s career had an "immeasurable impact on the territory and all Yukoners". "On behalf of all Yukoners, my colleagues and I offer our condolences to his family, friends and former colleagues." Fentie served as Yukon’s Premier from 2002 to 2011. Golden Predator is advancing the past-producing Brewery Creek mine towards a timely resumption of mining activities, under its quartz mining and water licences. With established resources grading over 1.0 g/t gold and low capital expenditure, Brewery Creek has a clear path to production as an economically and environmentally known project.
