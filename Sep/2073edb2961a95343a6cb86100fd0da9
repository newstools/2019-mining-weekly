PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The Western Australian government has granted the proposed EcoGraf battery graphite project, being developed by ASX-listed Kibaran Resources, lead agency support. Premier Mark McGowan noted that the Kwinana-based project was aligned with the state government’s Future Battery Industry strategy, and represented a significant step in diversifying the state’s downstream processing activities and Western Australia’s contribution to the global battery value chain. The EcoGraf project is expected to cost an initial $22.8-million to develop a 5 000 t/y operation, followed by a further $49.2-million investment to increase production to 20 000 t/y of battery graphite. The project will import natural flake graphite from existing producers and convert it to battery graphite, with the final product to be exported to customers in Asia, Europe and the US. Kibaran is expected to make a final investment decision early next year, with first production targeted for early 2021. Kibaran MD Andrew Spinks said support from the state government would help the company secure the remaining pre-development approvals and conclude stakeholder negotiations.
