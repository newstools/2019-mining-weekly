PERTH (miningweekly.com) â€“ ASX-listed OM Holdings has recovered the body of its employee Craig Butler, following a wall failure at the Bootu Creek manganese mine, in the Northern Territory, on August 24. OM on Thursday said mining operations at Bootu Creek remained suspended, with the company hoping to make a staged re-start to in-pit mining by the end of October, subject to the completion of a report by independent geotechnical engineers to facilitate the restart approvals. Processing operations at Bootu Creek were restarted on August 25, with existing stockpiled material being processed through the heavy media separation plant and secondary processing plant, yielding a saleable lower-grade manganese product. The stockpiled product is expected to yield some 110 000 t of lower-grade product in addition to the original production plan, albeit at a lower rate of production owing to operational constraints. The processing of the lower-grade stockpiles will continue for two months, OM said on Thursday, noting that the tailings retreatment plant would not be fully commissioned, as originally forecast, until the mining operations have restarted. OM is expected third-quarter production to reach 103 000 t, while production in the fourth quarter would be dependent on access to higher grade ores. Meanwhile, the ASX-listed company noted that its smelting division has remained unaffected by the mine suspension, with alternative sources of manganese ore having been sourced as substitutes to ensure the continuity of manganese alloy production.
