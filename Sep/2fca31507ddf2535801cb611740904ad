The Amulsar gold project, which is opposed by some ecologists and residents in Armenia, could potentially be producing by late next year, or early 2021, Canadian project developer Lydian International has confirmed. The company is looking at restarting construction by April or May next year, although some rehabilitation and earth-moving associated with site recovery could start earlier, interim CEO Edward Sellers said this week. This comes as Armenia Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan said that access to the Amulsar project should be restored and that protestors blocking access should open the roads. Citing a live Facebook broadcast of Pashinyan, Lydian stated that the Prime Minister had said that there was no legal basis on which the government could prevent the company from advancing Amulsar in accordance with permits based on an existing environmental impact assessment (EIA) or require an additional EIA regarding the Amulsar project at this time. Pashinyan reportedly said that stopping the Amulsar project on environmental grounds would illustrate a discriminatory approach regarding Lydian and not enhance Armenia’s ability to attract foreign investment. The government has committed to conduct inspections to ensure that the company complied with its permits. Work on the Amulsar project was halted in June last year, when protestors set up illegal blockades preventing access to the mine. Before the demonstrations, Lydian was working towards entering production at the 225 000 oz/y mine in the fourth quarter of 2018, ramping up to full output in 2019. Environmental groups and some locals campaigned against the mining project over concerns that it would pollute the Jermuk springs. But the project has been subject to three full-scale environmental audits in the last 12 months, all of which it passed. Amulsar's estimated mineral resources contain 3.5-million measured and indicated gold ounces and 1.3-million inferred gold ounces.
