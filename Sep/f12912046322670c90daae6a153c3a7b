Alrosa said on Thursday its supervisory board will consider terminating the Russian diamond miner's participation in the share capital of Alrosa-Nyurba on September 10 by way of voluntary liquidation of Alrosa-Nyurba. The voluntary liquidation, in case it gets an approval from Alrosa's board and then from Alrosa-Nyurba's board and shareholders, would be completed by the end of 2020, it said. Alrosa, which holds a 97.5% stake in Alrosa-Nyurba, said the liquidation of Alrosa-Nyurba will not affect its financial results. Management believes consolidating core assets, including licences, on the parent companyâ€™s balance would improve efficiency and lower costs, Alrosa CEO Sergey Ivanov said in a statement from the company.
