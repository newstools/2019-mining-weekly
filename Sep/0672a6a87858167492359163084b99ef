PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Junior Sunstone Metals has raised A$4.6-million from the underwriting and exercise of options priced at 3c and 3.2c a share, which will go towards accelerating drilling at the Bramaderos gold/copper project, in Ecuador. “Our ability to secure these funds reflects the strong potential of Bramaderos,” said Sunstone MD Malcolm Norris. “Drilling at the Bramaderos Main prospect has delivered significant grades and widths of mineralisation in an outcropping gold/copper porphyry deposit and demonstrates the potential to deliver a sizeable gold/copper system.” Norris said that Sunstone now had a parallel drilling programme drilling the high-grade West Zone epithermal gold target. Drilling was also continuing at the Limon prospect, which is part of a package of multiple outcropping and near-surface gold/copper porphyry systems identified at Bramaderos, where only two holes have been drilled to date.
