PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Diversified miner Rio Tinto’s Canadian aluminium operations have been extended with the Aluminium Stewardship Initiative’s (ASI) Chain of Custody certification, reinforcing the miner’s commitment to responsible mining and metals production. The certification provides independent verification that material can be traced through a ‘chain of custody’ spanning Rio’s Gove bauxite mine in Australia to its alumina refinery, aluminium smelters and casthouses in Quebec and British Columbia, Canada. Rio said this week that the ASI certification meant customers can be assured the aluminium purchased through Rio’s Canadian operations has been produced to the highest environmental, social and governance standards. Rio Tinto Aluminium VP for sales and marketing and ASI Board member Tolga Egrilmezer said the certification continues Rio’s leadership on responsible production. “It increases the availability of ASI certified aluminium in a range of markets, giving customers the ability to offer end consumers products made with aluminium that meets the highest sustainability standards.” In 2018, Rio was the first company to receive the ASI’s first Performance Standard certification, the highest internationally recognised standard for robust environmental, social and governance practices, and Chain of Custody certification, covering five aluminium smelters, the Vaudreuil refinery, casting centres, port and railway facilities in Quebec, Canada. The BC Works smelter and Kemano Power Operations received certification against the Performance Standard in January 2019 and have now been included in the Chain of Custody certification. Rio is now working with the ASI on audits and certifications for other sites in its global aluminium business.
