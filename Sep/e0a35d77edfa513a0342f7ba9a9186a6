Emerging tungsten producer Premier African Minerals has, by way of a direct subscription, raised £250 000, before expenses, at an issue price of 0.02p per new ordinary share. This is expected to be the last direct placement Premier will need in advance of expectations of the prospecting order application at Zulu lithium and tantalum project, as well as the ongoing electrification at the RHA tungsten mine, in Zimbabwe, Premier CEO George Roach said on Friday. The company also reported ongoing increases in production tonnage at Otjozondu Mining, in Namibia, and said it “looks forward to the possibilities that a closer association with this mine will bring in the future to Premier and its shareholders”.
