PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed junior King Island Scheelite has reported an 18% increase in the tungsten resource at its Dolphin project, in Tasmania. The combined inferred and indicated resource at the Dolphin project now stood at 11.36-million tonnes, grading 0.9% tungsten. The increase in the resource estimate was driven by a recently completed resource estimate for the Bold Head scheelite deposit, carried out by an external consultant. The Bold Head deposit is estimated to host some 1.76-million tonnes, at 0.91% tungsten. “This is an exceptional result for King Island Scheelite with the increased indicated and inferred resources adding significantly to our total mineral resource and potentially increasing the mine life of our wholly-owned Dolphin tungsten project,” said chairperson Johann Jacobs. “This positive result builds on our recently released feasibility study and revised mineral reserve estimate, and forms a significant part of our road map to recommencing production at Dolphin, targeted for 2021.” An economic analysis of the Dolphin project estimated that some A$65-million would need to be invested to bring the opencut operation into production to produce 20 t/y of tungsten over an eight-year mine life.
