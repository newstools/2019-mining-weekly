PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Highfield Resources has inked a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Swiss-based agri business Ameropa AG for the sale of 250 000 t of muriate of potash (MoP) from the Muga mine, in Spain. “We are pleased to have signed this important offtake MoU, which is a further acknowledgement within the potash world that Highfields Muga mine will be an important first step in our commercialisation strategy and Ameropa brings extensive expertise and experience in the potash and fertilizer space,” said Highfield CEO Peter Albert. The offtake product will be a combination of both standard and granular MoP, with Highfield having the option to increase to 300 000 t/y. Highfield has been granted a positive environmental approval for the Muga project, and is working towards obtaining the remaining permits, which will enable it to start construction.
