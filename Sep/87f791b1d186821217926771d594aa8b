The Çöpler Saddle, which borders the western flank of the Çöpler mine, is shaping up to be an “outstanding” near-mine exploration project, TSX- and ASX-listed Alacer Gold CEO Rod Antal said on Thursday, announcing the exploration results from the shear zone. The initial testing of The Saddle consisted of 50 diamond drill holes with a strike length of more than 2 km. All holes were outside of the Çöpler resource shells and planned mining areas. The company reported that diamond drill holes intersected oxide and sulphide gold mineralisation, some with impressive grades and thicknesses. Hole CDD657 intersected 22.6 m at 9.65 g/t gold (oxide) from 24.5 m, including 6 m at 30.78 g/t gold (oxide) from 26.2 m and 1 m at 104 g/t gold (oxide) from 28.2 m and 1.4 m at 8.6 g/t gold (oxide) from 36.2 m. Hole CDD719 intersected 40.8 m at 4.74 g/t gold (oxide and sulphide) from 120.7 m, including 3.3 m at 6.94 g/t gold (oxide) from 129.8 m and 4.4 m at 25.78 g/t gold (oxide) from 137.1 m. CDD735 intersected 5.7 m at 39.45 g/t gold (oxide and sulphide) from 34.4 m, including 1.4 m at 155.5 g/t gold (sulphide) from 37.7 m and 2.2 m at 7.74 g/t gold (oxide and sulphide) from 47 m. “The Çöpler Saddle . . . [is] an important component of our short-term strategy to identify additional oxide ore that we can convert quickly into production by leveraging our existing infrastructure. With Ardich already shaping up to be a major discovery, and now with The Saddle showing potential, albeit at an earlier exploration stage, our short-term strategy is rapidly becoming a reality,” said Antal.
