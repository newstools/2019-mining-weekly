Aim-listed BlueRock Diamonds has sold a 10.6 ct diamond for $103 000. This is the sixth diamond sold for more than $50 000 this year. Together, the six diamonds have generated revenues of $600 000. BlueRock executive chairperson Mike Houston says the sale of another high-value diamond continues to “underpin the increasing potential” of the Kareevlei mine, in Kimberley, South Africa.
