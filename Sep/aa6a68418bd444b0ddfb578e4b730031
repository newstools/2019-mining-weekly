South Africa's Impala Platinum Holdings (Implats) on Thursday said it swung into an annual profit boosted by higher sales, gains in rhodium and palladium prices, and improved performance at its Rustenburg operations. The platinum miner reported headline earnings per share (HEPS) of 423 cents for the year ended June 30, compared to a loss of 171 cents a year earlier. HEPS strips out certain one-off items and is the main profit measure in South Africa.
