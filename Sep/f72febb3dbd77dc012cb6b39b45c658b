Underground mine development at Canada-headquartered Ivanhoe Mines’ Kamoa-Kakula copper mine, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, has reached the edge of the high-grade ore within the deposit as mining advances toward zones in excess of 8% copper. The advancement of the first connecting underground drift, designed to tunnel through the centre of the high-grade orebody and open up the mine's initial mineral reserves, has reached the edge of the high-grade ore. Grades of about 4% copper have been returned from sampling. Grades are expected to increase considerably as the development crews advance the drifts towards the deposit’s central mining zones that are in excess of 8% copper. “This intersection marks a significant milestone in the context of our exploration and development efforts at Kamoa-Kakula that began more than 13 years ago,” says Kamoa-Kakula copper project geology manager David Edwards. “Now that you can see and touch Kakula’s high-grade copper ore, it really hits home that we are well on our way towards building the first of multiple high-grade copper mines in the area.” Mine and processing plant construction is also progressing well and remains on track for first copper concentrate production in the third quarter of 2021.
