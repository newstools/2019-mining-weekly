JSE-listed resources group Exxaro Resources won a silver award in the service design category at the 2019 Loeries, which was the highest award given in the category this year, for its MyNexxt: Future-ready workforce learning platform. The Loeries has been Africa and the Middle East’s premier award since 1979, recognising excellence in advertising and brand communication. Exxaro partnered with multinational professional services company Accenture and WinWin to develop MyNexxt, which supports, upskills and prepares Exxaro’s 15 000 employees for a digital future. With 71% of mining industry jobs at risk of automation in the next 20 years, Exxaro challenged Accenture to think beyond the technical limitations of existing solutions, using service design to achieve visibility and to meet engagement criteria. Exxaro is implementing the learning and development platform at its Grootegeluk and Belfast coal operations. “By using new multimedia, rich video, audio and animation, the solution aims to empower the community to think more intuitively, which reduces the risk of job obsoletion.
