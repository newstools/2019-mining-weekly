The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) has expressed concern about the death of an employee at the Two Rivers platinum mine, a joint venture operation between African Rainbow Minerals and Impala Platinum, in Limpopo. The union on Tuesday said moving machinery at the South Main Decline at the mine had driven over an employee on Monday afternoon. The NUM called on the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy to investigate the cause of the incident and on mining companies to prioritise the health and safety of workers over profits. It sent its condolences to the family of the deceased.
