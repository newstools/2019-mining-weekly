JSE- and NYSE-listed Gold Fields has again been ranked the top South African mining company on the prestigious Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) database.
 
The 2019 DJSI scorecard, which was published on Tuesday, shows that Gold Fields’ sustainability practices rank with the best of resources companies worldwide, the gold miner says. Gold Fields is ranked fourth of around 61 mining companies assessed and is ranked as the third best global gold company. Gold Fields is also an index component of the DJSI. It has participated in the DJSI assessment, which is carried out by investment firm RobecoSAM on behalf of the DJSI, since 2000. Launched in 1999, the DJSI ranks the performance of global sustainability leaders, through an annual assessment of the world's 1 200 largest public companies.
 
The DJSI measures a range of management practices surrounding environmental, social and governance issues. These include commitment to and reporting on health and safety, corporate governance, climate strategy, water-related risks, human rights and social impacts on communities.
 
"Our continued strong showing on the DJSI illustrates that we are successfully integrating sustainability practices into our business. There will always be areas of improvement, particularly in further strengthening our relations with impacted host communities, but overall I think we are on the right track," says Gold Fields CEO Nick Holland.
