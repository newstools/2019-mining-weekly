PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Rare earths miner Lynas has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the city of Kalgoorlie-Boulder to potentially build a cracking and leaching operation in the area. The MoU provided a framework for support from the city of Kalgoorlie-Boulder in key areas relevant to ensuring that the new cracking and leaching plant was successful, including land availability, water, gas, electricity, access roads and other infrastructure. Lynas in May announced plans for a cracking and leaching plant in Western Australia as part of its 2025 growth plans, with the Malaysian government earlier this year also renewing the company’s operating licence in Malaysia on the condition that its cracking and leaching operations in that country be closed down within the next four years. Lynas CEO and MD Amanda Lacaze on Friday noted that following preliminary site assessment studies, Kalgoorlie and the Lynas mine site, at Mt Weld, were short-listed as the preferred locations for the facility, with a final decision yet to be made. “We are very pleased to announce this MoU with the city of Kalgoorlie-Boulder. Kalgoorlie has a rich mining history and continues to work with industry to develop the region and its communities,” she said. The noted that access to infrastructure and a skilled workforce made Kalgoorlie an attractive investment destination, and with the MoU in place, the company could further assess the suitability of potential sites within Kalgoorlie. “The local councils in both of our preferred locations have welcomed the opportunity to host our Western Australian cracking and leaching facility, and we look forward to updating the market on further developments,” Lacaze said.
