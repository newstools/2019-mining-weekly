PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The A$1-billion Winchester South project is a step closer to development after owner Whitehaven Coal was given terms of reference for the environmental impact statement (EIS). Whitehaven could now start working on the draft EIS for public consultation. Queensland Minister for State Development Cameron Dick noted that the proposed project, which was previously declared as a Coordinated Project, could extract up to eight-million tonnes a year of metallurgical coal, with a mine life of around 30 years, and had the potential to deliver 500 new construction jobs and support up to 450 full-time jobs once operational. “That type of production would contribute significantly to both the local and state economy, boosting our exports and supporting communities in the region,” Dick said. If approved, it is estimated construction of the project would start in 2021, with the first extraction of coal proposed for 2023.
