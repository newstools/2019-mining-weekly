PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Junior Beacon Minerals has produced its first gold bar at the Juardi gold project, in Western Australia. “First gold production in bullion marks a significant achievement for the company, particularly given the first exploration drilling at Juardi commenced in January 2017,” said Beacon MD Graham McGarry. The Juardi plant commissioning has progressed ahead of schedule, he added, with commercial production at Juardi planned for October 1. The A$21.4-million project is expected to recover some 126 000 oz of gold over a five-year mine life, generating life-of-mine revenues of around A$208.5-million and surplus operating cash flows of A$98.4-million at a gold price of A$1 650/oz.
