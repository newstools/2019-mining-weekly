Alaska-focused exploration and development company Trilogy Metals on Thursday announced the resignation of Rick Van Nieuwenhuyse as CEO, president and director and named Jim Gowans as his interim successor. Gowans is a director of Trilogy and was president and CEO of Arizona Mining before the company was bought by South32. Trilogy stated that Gowans had extensive experience in Alaska. He completed the feasibility study for the Red Dog mine, oversaw the design and construction of that mine and then operated Red Dog for three years after commissioning. Van Nieuwenhuyse would remain as a consultant to the company until January 31, 2020 and would assist with transitional matters and with advancing the company’s interests in Alaska. A search for a permanent CEO would start shortly. Trilogy is exploring and developing the Ambler mining district located in north-western Alaska. It hosts polymetallic volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS) deposits that contain copper, zinc, lead, gold and silver, and carbonate replacement deposits, which have been found to host high-grade copper mineralisation. Exploration efforts have been focused on two deposits in the Ambler mining district - the Arctic VMS deposit and the Bornite carbonate replacement deposit. Both deposits are located within the company's land package that spans about 143 000 ha. It is the company’s vision to develop the Ambler mining district into a premier North American copper producer.
