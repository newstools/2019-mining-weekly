TSX-V-listed Victoria Gold has successfully poured the first gold at its Eagle Gold mine, in central Yukon. “After all the blood, sweat and tears required to explore, develop, permit, finance and build a gold mine in Canada’s north, it is extremely gratifying to pour the first gold bar at Eagle,” stated president and CEO John McConnell on Wednesday. The inaugural gold bar was poured by Sandy Silver, Yukon’s Premier, and weighed in at 1 001 oz gold. Victoria reported that ramp-up of operations at site continued to proceed well and that it was exceeding the ramp-up schedule for ore mined and ore tonnes placed on the heap leach pad. When in production, the Eagle Gold mine will produce about 200 000 oz/y for 10 to 11 years, and will be the largest gold mine in Yukon history.
