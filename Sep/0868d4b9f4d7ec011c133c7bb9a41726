Gold major Newmont Goldcorp has inaugurated the Borden gold project, which it says opens a new mining district in Onatrio and represents the “mine of the future”. Located near Chapleau, the features state-of-the-art health and safety controls, digital mining technologies and processes, and low-carbon energy vehicles. “Borden opens a new gold mining district in Ontario and profitably extends operations at the Porcupine complex near Timmins,” said Newmont Goldcorp president and incoming CEO Tom Palmer in a news release. “In addition, Borden’s electric underground fleet will eliminate diesel particulate matter from the underground environment and lower greenhouse gas emissions. This will help reduce energy costs, protect employee health and minimise impacts to the environment.” Ore from Borden is processed at the existing mill at the Porcupine operation in Timmins, 180 km to the east. Borden is fully permitted for operation, and partnership agreements have been signed with local First Nations. The mine is expected to achieve commercial production in the fourth quarter of this year. At 1 000 km2, Borden’s land package represents additional exploration upside as the Borden deposit remains open at depth. In recognition of Borden’s contribution to the future of safe and sustainable mining, the Canadian and Ontario governments each granted C$5-million towards electrification of the mine. The inauguration was attended by several dignitaries, including Ontario’s Energy, Mines, Northern Development and Indigenous Affairs Minister Greg Rickford.
