Diversified resources company Exxaro Resources has, once again, qualified as one of South Africa’s Top Performing Companies in the mining sector. Top Performing, a South African publication, celebrates fast-growth organisations in both the private and public sectors. The achievement is based on a variety of criteria including yearly turnover, growth, competitiveness as a market leader, quality of operations and social economic development initiatives. After months of rigorous research and benchmarking, Top Performing Companies and the Public Sector’s team of researchers determined that Exxaro met the criteria required to be considered one of the best mining companies in the country. “Qualifying for an award that celebrates high performance and success is particularly important to us as it serves as proof that our efforts to power better lives in Africa and beyond ar not going unnoticed,” says Exxaro CEO Mxolisi Mgojo. At the same awards ceremony, Exxaro also received a Top Empowered Company certificate in recognition of the organisation’s commitment to transformation during this year. “Transformation is a core focus of Exxaro. The company continues to lead the way in this area, with people development initiatives and strategic transaction decisions designed to make a meaningful contribution to the development of a prosperous South African society, in its entirety,” states Mgojo.
