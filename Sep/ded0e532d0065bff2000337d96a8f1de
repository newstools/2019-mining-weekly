The Department of Trade, Industry and Competition (DTIC) is leading a delegation of South African mining product and service providers on an outward selling mission (OSM) to Chile and Peru, in South America. The mission started on September 24 and will end on October 4. The mission aims to expose the South African companies to export opportunities in Santiago and Lima, as well as the broader South American region. The two-week programme for the OSM will comprise a trade and investment seminar, business-to-business meetings and site visits in targeted sectors of capital mining equipment and mining services. Trade and Industry Deputy Minister Fikile Majola said the mission would afford the business delegation the opportunity to introduce their products directly to their target market and key industry players, including importers, distributors and the mining industry as a whole. “The mission will also improve access to network, market and build relationships with potential importers,” he added. The DTIC said Chile’s open-market-oriented and trade-friendly environment has been particularly attractive to investors because of its upward economic growth trajectory, established banking sectors, transparent regulatory environment and political stability. A multisectorial OSM to Peru last year proved to be successful in creating awareness and promoting South African products and services. The previous mission resulted in 84 positive trade leads and on-the-spot export sales amounting to R880 270, with prospects for future sales reported by mission delegates. South African exports to Chile amounted to R774-million last year, while imports amounted to R2-billion. South African exports to Peru amounted to R413-million last year, while imports totalled R710-million. The companies’ participation in the OSM is funded by the DTIC through its Export Marketing and Investment Assistance Scheme, which develops export markets for South African products and services.
