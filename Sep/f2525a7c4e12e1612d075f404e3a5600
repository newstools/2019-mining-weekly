MEXICO CITY â€“ Mexico's President Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Monday that he has asked the parties involved in an ongoing conflict at the Penasquito gold mine in Mexico to do their part to help resolve their differences. "We're asking everyone to help reach an agreement," Lopez Obrador said at his daily press conference when asked about the situation at the openpit mine located in northern Zacatecas state. The world's top gold producer, Newmont Goldcorp, said on September 18 it had offered $25-million in community investments and land rental fees to resolve the conflict at its Penasquito mine, but activists said they were unsatisfied.
