PERTH (miningweekly.com) â€“ The Northern Territory will this week follow in the footsteps of its Western Australian counterpart with the introduction of a Bill into Parliament that will overhaul the industrial manslaughter laws, and ensure that all businesses are penalized for reckless or negligent conduct leading to workplace fatalities. Currently, only individuals can be charged with industrial manslaughter with no equivalent penalties for corporations. Earlier this year, the Western Australian government flagged the introduction of a new Work Health and Safety Bill which will introduce industrial manslaughter laws punishable by up to 20 years' imprisonment. The new offences will also carry a fine of up to A$10-million for a body corporate.
