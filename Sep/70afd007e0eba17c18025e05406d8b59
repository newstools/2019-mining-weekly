PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Junior Anson Resources has unveiled plans to build a modular bromine plant at the Paradox brine project, in Utah, to generate early cash flow. The bromine plant’s build will be subject to the current bromine test work being completed at the project. The ASX-listed Anson on Monday said that the cash generated by the bromine plant would be used to assist in the funding of a planned lithium pilot plant, and the commercial-sized bromine/lithium plant. Anson told shareholders that the development of a modular bromine plant would alleviate the need to pre-treat the brine with chemicals in the lithium pilot plant, and as a result, would also save on development costs. The bromine extraction process will also provide the necessary brine pre-treatment required, Anson said.
