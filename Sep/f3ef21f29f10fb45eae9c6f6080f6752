Dual-listed Mkango Resources has appointed Senet, a DRA Global company, as lead engineer and project manager to complete the feasibility study for the Songwe Hill rare earths project in Malawi. The study is being funded by Mkango’s strategic partner, Talaxis, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Noble Group Holdings. Senet has extensive project and construction experience throughout Africa, as well as a notable hydrometallurgical process engineering team on the continent. Senet’s appointment marks another milestone for completion of the feasibility study and development of the project. A number of work streams for the study, including mining studies, comminution, flotation, hydrometallurgical test work, and studies in relation to the environmental, social and health impact assessment, are under way. “We are very pleased to appoint Senet for the Songwe feasibility study,” Mkango CE William Dawes said in a statement on Monday. “The selection of Senet was measured against a range of criteria, and its technical capabilities and African experience were key factors in the decision. Mkango has the right financial and technical partnerships in place to enable development of Songwe into Africa's leading producer of rare earths,” he added. Senet MD Darren Naylor said participation in the project offered the company a unique opportunity to continue demonstrating its diverse capability across Africa. Talaxis executive director Daniel Mamadou indicated that Songwe held the potential to become a significant rare earths producer in Africa, and played an important part in Talaxis’ upstream investment portfolio.
