NYSE- and TSX-listed Barrick Gold's acquisition of London-listed Acacia Mining became effective on Tuesday after all the conditions precedent were either met or waived. Barrick in June proposed a takeover offer to other Acacia shareholders of 193p a share. Acacia was established in 2010, when Barrick spun out its African operations into a separate entity, then called African Barrick Gold (ABG). Barrick retained a 64% interest in ABG, which, in 2014, changed its name to Acacia Mining. Barrick resolved to bring the Tanzania-focused Acacia back into the fold in June amid a protracted disputed between Acacia and Tanzanian authorities about its gold operations in that country. Acacia rejected Barrick's initial buyout offer, but in July, following negotiations, it agreed to an increased offer of 232p a share. Barrick, which is led by CEO Mark Bristow, in December 2018 acquired London-listed Randgold Resources, which also holds operations in Africa.
