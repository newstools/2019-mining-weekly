Africa-focused energy company Kibo Energy has been informed by its Tanzanian subsidiary, Mbeya Power, that its water rights for the Mbeya coal-to-power project (MCPP), obtained in August 2018, were successfully renewed ahead of schedule. This ensures that the MCPP environmental-impact-assessment certification remains valid and maintains the right to use large quantities of water, a strategic commodity for the MCPP, specifically by the power station. “I am very encouraged by the overall progress being made at MCCP,” commented Kibo CEO Louis Coetzee in a statement on Wednesday. He indicated that the renewal of the water permits, so soon after the recent approval and processing of seven mining rights for the project, augmented his confidence in the project’s potential.
