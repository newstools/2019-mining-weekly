PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The Queensland Resources Council has welcomed diversified miner Glencore’s expansion of its Indigenous Employment Pathways Program in central Queensland. Starting in February next year, the programme aims to provide employment opportunities for 20 Indigenous Australians close to the company’s coal operations. Glencore said that the programme built on a successful pilot Pathways Programme conducted this year, which resulted in eight Indigenous participants finding employment. QRC CEO Ian Macfarlane said the resources sector had a resolute commitment to playing its part in creating economic opportunities for Indigenous Australians. “Economic opportunities for Indigenous Australians are essential to making meaningful strides towards the Closing the Gap targets and the resources sector has an important role to play,” Macfarlane said. “Last year Indigenous employment grew by 11% in the resources sector. The resources sector is committed to doing even more to extend economic opportunities to First Nations people, and we hope to see other sectors join us with the same goal. “The resources sector is one of only two sectors in Queensland with a genuine representation of Indigenous employees. Indigenous people comprise 4% of the State’s workforce in resources and Queensland’s Indigenous population is 4%. “As a sector that largely operates in regional and remote communities with high Indigenous populations our sector has a unique opportunity to be a leader in Indigenous employment.”
