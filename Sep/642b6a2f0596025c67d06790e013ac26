The Kamoa-Kakula copper project, in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), has reported its first fatality, after having gone more than seven-and-a-half years without a lost-time injury. Canada-headquartered Ivanhoe Mines reported on Tuesday that a contractor’s employee had died at the copper project. The accident involved a civil contractor at a surface cement batching plant. "We are all deeply saddened by the tragic loss of life at the Kamoa-Kakula project and our thoughts are with the family, friends and co-workers of the deceased at this time. Safety for everyone at our projects is our highest priority,” said Ivanhoe president Tony Giardini. The Kamoa-Kakula project is a joint venture between Ivanhoe Mines (39.6%), Zijin Mining Group (39.6%), Crystal River Global (0.8%) and the DRC government (20%).
