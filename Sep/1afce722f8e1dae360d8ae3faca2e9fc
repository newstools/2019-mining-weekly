London-listed IMC Exploration has completed a mineral resource estimate for its Avoca historic mine site project, located in county Wicklow, Ireland. The total tonnage of dumps in Tigroney East, Mount Platt and Cronebane was calculated at 1.87-million tonnes, at 0.14% copper, 0.42% lead, 0.14% zinc, 0.3% gold and 9 parts per million silver. The estimate is based on data from 14 sample pits, dug with an excavator and reflecting representative vertical intervals throughout the spoils’ heaps. Samples were taken from each sample pit sample stockpile and used to calculate an in-situ bulk density of 1.59 t/m3. IMC is to establish an environmental clean-up operation to remove metals from the existing mine waste at the project site. “The mineral resource estimate for our spoils and tailings project in Avoca, Co. Wicklow is of great significance. There is further potential to increase the tonnage and grade, not only on this site but also on other spoil heaps within IMC's licence areas. The scale of this opportunity at Avoca is transformational for IMC and its shareholders,” commented chairperson Eamon O’Brien. IMC would increase the tonnage and grade of the resource estimate by conducting further investigations, including basal topography surveying, as well as the investigation of other spoil heaps present in the area, particularly at West Avoca.
