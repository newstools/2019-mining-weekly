The Araxá and Tapira phosphate mines of The Mosaic Company have resumed mining at full capacity, following the idling of these mines in April to comply with stability certification of their tailings dams. The Catalão mine, also idled due to the regulatory requirements, resumed operations in June. The January dam disaster of iron-ore miner Vale prompted new rules for tailings dams, which also affected Mosaic’s operations. “I am proud of how our teams responded to meet the new regulatory requirements in Brazil,” commented Mosaic Fertilizantes senior vice-president Rick McLellan. “Solid execution across our business has allowed us to return these operations to full capacity ahead of plan and ensures that we are positioned to meet farmer demand heading into Brazil’s key planting season. “We believe the revised regulatory requirements will make mining safer for our employees, our communities and the environment.”
