ASX-listed gold developer West African Resources has strengthened its board and management team as construction advances, and the company prepares for mid-2020 production at the Sanbrado gold project in Burkina Faso. MD Richard Hyde has been promoted to executive chairperson and CEO; and COO Lyndon Hopkins has joined the board as an executive director. Board skills and experience have also been enhanced with the appointment of mining industry executives Rod Leonard and Nigel Spicer as independent nonexecutive directors. Mark Connelly and Simon Storm will continue as nonexecutive directors, while Ian Kerr has resigned from the board. This restructure results in four independent nonexecutive directors on West African’s six-member board. Further, Luke Holden has been appointed operations GM; Stuart Cruickshanks technical services GM; and Todd Giltay as finance GM. “We welcome the new directors and managers to the West African team and look forward to their contributions as we transition Sanbrado from construction to operations. We would also like to thank Ian Kerr for his service to the company and wish him the best in his future endeavours,” commented Hyde. He indicated that site construction activities and the underground decline were progressing to schedule.
