Midtier Africa-focused gold miner Pan African Resources expects to report headline earnings per share (HEPS) of between $0.014 and $0.024 for the financial year ended June 30. This compares with HEPS of $0.009 reported for the 2018 financial year. The JSE- and Aim-listed miner's presentation currency for the 2019 financial year has changed to the dollar, from the previous years' presentation currency of pounds sterling, as this is expected to provide a more comparable presentation currency for the group's financial position, performance and cash flow.
