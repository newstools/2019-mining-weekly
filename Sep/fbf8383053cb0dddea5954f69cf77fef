JOHANNESBURG â€“ Canadian gold miner Banro Corporation declared force majeure on several of its operations in Democratic Republic of Congo earlier this month, its chief executive said in a letter addressed to Congolese officials and seen by Reuters. Banro Corp suspended operations at Banro Mining Congo, Namoya Mining, Lugushwa Mining and Kamituga Mining, saying "serious security problems" persisted despite the release in recent weeks of employees taken hostage by rebels in July. A Banro employee, who asked not to be named, confirmed the contents of the September 24 letter written by CEO Brett Richards. The letter also said the company's Twangiza site would remain operational.
