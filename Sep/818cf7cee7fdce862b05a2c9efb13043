PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Base metals hopeful Heron Resources on Wednesday announced that CEO and MD Wayne Taylor will be stepping aside immediately, at the request of the board. The company said that the hunt for a replacement CEO was under way. The ASX-listed company told shareholders this week that it was looking to recapitalize in response to a working capital deficiency that was caused by the effective seven-month delay in the construction of the Woodlawn project, in New South Wales. Heron was expecting to make an announcement regarding the financing before the end of the month, with the junior’s shares to remain suspended from trading.
