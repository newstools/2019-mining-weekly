One of the world’s largest jewellery retailers Chow Tai Fook has launched its Peace Angel collection, a collaboration with Platinum Guild International (PGI), to celebrate its ninetieth anniversary. The collection includes more than 20 different designs and is available exclusively in platinum. PGI says it innovatively combines the world’s rarest precious metal with eye-catching enamel in the Chow Tai Fook brand’s distinctive red. This is the first Chow Tai Fook collection to combine these two materials. “Chow Tai Fook believes jewellery is not just a simple item of value or a decorative accessory, it has a mission to communicate the wearer’s attitude and beliefs. The combination of platinum’s purity, rarity and tenacity, with the bold passionate outward expression of red enamel, celebrates both the inner strength and external elegance of China’s modern women,” comments Chow Tai Fook group branding GM Alan Chan. “Despite market challenges facing the luxury industry including all jewellery categories, our partners continue to commit to innovation that connects with today’s jewellery consumers. PGI collaborates with the jewellery industry on product design, marketing and in-store activation to drive awareness and boost sales of new-generation platinum jewellery in China. “Chow Tai Fook has always been a leader in platinum jewellery and we are thrilled that they should choose to celebrate such an auspicious occasion by yet again pushing the boundaries of platinum innovation," says PGI CEO Huw Daniel.
