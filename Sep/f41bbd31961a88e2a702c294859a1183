Potash and phosphates major Nutrien has announced an up to eight-week shutdown at its Allan, Lanigan and Vanscoy potash mines, in Saskatchewan, in response to a slowdown in global potash markets. The company said this week that if all three potash facilities were to be idled for the full eight weeks, production could be reduced by about 700 000 t. The earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation impact would be between $100-million and $150-million. “Despite the current short-term market conditions, we remain positive on potash demand for 2020, as well as the medium to long-term potash fundamentals. "We remain focused on a gradual ramp up of production to meet demand and to ensure we operate the safest, most reliable and efficient Potash business in the world,” Nutrien said in a statement. Last month, The Mosaic Company announced that the Colonsay mine, also in Saskatchewan, would be shut down until prices improved and earlier this week, the company said it would idle its Lousiana phosphates operations to help balance the global market.
