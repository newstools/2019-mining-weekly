LIMA â€“ Peru expects its copper production to grow 27% and gold output to expand 12% in the next three years by 2022, the country's Energy and Mines Minister said on Thursday. Peru is the world's No.2 copper producer and sixth-largest gold producer. Peru is on track to produce 2.5-million tonnes of copper this year, up slightly from last year's 2.44-million tonnes, Francisco Ismodes said. Copper production has surged 77% in the past four years. "This has been our best year yet for copper production," Ismodes said in a broadcast presentation at a mining event in southern Peru.
