The Administrative Court of Appeal in Sundsvall has rejected an appeal against Coppertone Resources’ Sandberget 500 permit, the Swedish company announced on Thursday. The Mining Inspector’s decision in February, and the Administrative Court in Luleå's verdict thereon, from August, consequently stand. Copperstone said in a statement that the Administrative Court of Appeal had not granted leave to appeal and that a resolution could only be appealed to the Supreme Administrative Court of Sweden in Stockholm. All exploration permits with regard to the Copperstone project (Sandberget 200, 300, 400 and 500) are valid up to 2022. “We are happy to see the swift handling of this case by the authorities. We can now focus fully on the ongoing drilling at Viscaria, where Kati Oy is already at hole three, while we are awaiting assay results for VDD0201 and VDD0202,” CEO Michael Mattsson commented.
