Niger has formally approved a revision to the shape of the Madaouela 1 mining permit that forms part of dual-listed GoviEx Uranium’s flagship Madaouela uranium project. The revision includes the additional 5.96-million pounds of uranium oxide (U3O8) in the measured and indicated categories associated with the Miriam uranium deposit, as well as the 17.88-million pounds of U3O8 in the measured and indicated categories associated with the Madaouela South North East (MNSE) deposit, both previously situated within the Agaliouk exploration permit. Moreover, the State has confirmed that the environmental- and social-impact assessment certificate for the Madaouela 1 mining permit also covers both the Miriam and MNSE deposits. As this mineralisation is not in a proven and/or probable mineral reserves category, these mineral resources have not been included in the economic technical study included in the 2015 prefeasibility study. These 23.84-million pounds of measured and indicated mineral resources were discovered and delineated by GoviEx’s geologic exploration team, chairperson Govind Friedland says. “As a result of this focused effort, as well as GoviEx’s continued social and environmental work and support and cooperation with the State, these resources are now included in the Madaouela 1 mining permit. “We warmly welcome this significant milestone, as we advance the optimisation work and the de-risking efforts of the targeted mineral resources contained within the Madaouela project.”
