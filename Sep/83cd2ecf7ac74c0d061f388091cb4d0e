JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) – As the circular economy grows, it poses a major risk for mining companies because, essentially, it means that people are reusing the same products over and over, thereby using less and less of the raw materials that are mined by mining companies, Webber Wentzel environment and natural resources partner Garyn Rapson points out. Mining companies can, however, survive amid an increasing drive towards the circular economy if they listen to their customers. Further, there were also potential benefits to operationalising the circular economy, he noted during a mining round-up event at the law firm’s offices, in Sandton, on Tuesday. In doing so, mining companies will “be the winners” in the eyes of consumers in terms of the metals and materials they produce, while simultaneously creating a platform for economic benefits to operationalise on-site from projects. This would be key, he added, since mining companies that operationalise the circular economy would be ahead of the curve as the global economy moves into a world post the Fourth Industrial Revolution. “Not only will you be preferred from your customer’s perspective, but you will be able to generate revenue if you take some of these projects seriously,” Rapson highlighted. He cautioned, however, that mining companies had to seek proper regulatory advice and ensure the right approvals and consents were in place, as that would form the foundation on which these projects could be implemented effectively.
