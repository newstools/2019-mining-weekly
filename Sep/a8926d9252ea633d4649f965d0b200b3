JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) – The twenty-sixth Investing in African Mining Indaba – scheduled to take place in Cape Town from February 3 to 6 next year – will offer delegates new insight into issues facing Africa’s resources sector. “We’re building on the success of the 2019 Mining Indaba in terms of the high level of government participation and the substantial increase in the number of investors attending the event. We believe that mining executives can fit in a month’s worth of meetings in four days,” Mining Indaba head of content Tom Quinn stated in a media release to Mining Weekly. “Overall, the focus of the event will be on investment in the digital economy of mining. Investment in African mining is, after all, the primary purpose of Mining Indaba. We saw more investors attending the event than at any other event – over 600 – in 2019. In addition to the VIP Investor Lounge, the Junior Mining Showcase, and the Investment Battlefield, we’re improving the business matchmaking platform so that it’s faster and easier for investors and mining companies to connect,” said Quinn, who highlighted these new additions to the programme: Attendees will again be provided with unmatched access to the entire mining industry value chain and influential market participants, Quinn assured.
