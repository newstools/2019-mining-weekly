Coal miner and trader Minergy has appointed Jean-Pierre van Staden as its new CFO, effective January 2, 2020. He will succeed Morné du Plessis, who was recently appointed CEO. Van Staden is a chartered accountant who has been an audit partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers in South Africa since 2004. He is a JSE- and TSX-accredited auditor and has extensive regulatory and stock exchange experience across several well recognised stock exchanges, including the JSE, the TSX, the LSE and the LSE's Aim. He has extensive auditing experience, having worked with listed multinational companies operating across a variety of industries in Africa and internationally. Importantly, he has extensive experience working with and providing services to junior and major mining and construction companies, industrial products companies, and private equity investment entities. “Jean-Pierre’s vast mining sector experience, especially in coal, as well as his significant listed company experience, was a major factor in his appointment,” says Du Plessis. Minergy chairperson Mokwena Morulane pointed out that Van Staden had also previously worked with several other companies in Botswana, where Minergy is developing its 390-million-tonne Masama coal mine. Morulane added that this provided Van Staden "with knowledge of the country, which we believe will be important as Minergy works to be a leading coal producer in Botswana and Southern Africa”.
