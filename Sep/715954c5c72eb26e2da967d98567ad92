Gold miner Eldorado Gold is considering expanding its Lamaque mine, in Val d’Or, Quebec, to increase production from an average of 130 000 oz/y to about 170 000 oz/y. The expansion, which is in a preliminary economic assessment (PEA) stage, is looking at increasing throughput from an average of about 1 800 t/d to 2 500 t/d. Lamaque achieved commercial production at the end of March this year and has an initial mine life of seven years. The expansion PEA will consider a ten-year mine life with target production of 1.5-million ounces of gold. To expand Lamaque to 2 500 t/d, a 2 km decline and conveyor system from the Sigma mill to the 400 m level of the Triangle deposit will be considered, as well as upgrades to the Sigma mill and construction of a paste plant to provide a long-term tailings solution. Construction of the decline could start in 2020, as it provided reduced haulage costs under any production scenario, as well as other strategic benefits that include the efficient recovery of potential resources at depth. Timing of other major construction will depend on results of the PEA and prefeasibility study (PFS), as well as the timing of other projects the company might have under way. The PEA would be completed in the fourth quarter of this year and a PFS would potentially be completed in the second half of next year. Eldorado also owns mines in Turkey and Greece. Last week, the company received long-awaited permits for its Greek projects.
