PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The Minerals Council of Australia (MCA) on Thursday welcomed the introduction of the greenfields discussion paper by Industrial Relations Minister Christian Porter. The discussion paper would look to allow greenfields agreements to cover the life of the project, beyond the current maximum of four years, and related to all major infrastructure and commercial projects, thus avoiding industrial action and providing certainty to investors. Porter on Thursday told Parliament that overall, industrial uncertainty and the impact of industrial action could add significant costs and delay to major infrastructure projects, many of which are, at least in part, funded by the taxpayer. “The Productivity Commission stated that any weaknesses in bargaining for a greenfields agreement can have ‘potentially large impacts on major project investment in Australia’ and that current arrangements ‘pose risks for large capital‑intensive projects with urgent time frames’. This, in turn, poses significant risks to job creation in Australia,” Porter said. MCA CEO Tania Constable on Wednesday said that there were billions of dollars’ worth of potential resources projects being developed in Australia that will benefit from greater certainty and confidence that budget and schedule commitments can be met. “All parliamentarians should commit to supporting this important reform,” she added.
