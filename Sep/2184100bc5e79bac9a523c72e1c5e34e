Exploration company Red Lake Gold said on Tuesday that it had resumed field exploration at its Whirlwind Jack gold project, following a temporary suspension after a severe storm at the weekend. The Municipality of Red Lake, in Ontario declared a state of emergency on Saturday after the Fridayâ€™s storm, which had measured winds of more than 120 km/h. Red Lake Gold deployed its teams for inaugural exploration at its Whirlwind Jack project last week. The project is adjacent to the Dixie gold project being advanced by Great Bear Resources.
