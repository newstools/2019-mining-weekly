PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Canadian miner First Quantum Minerals is planning a restart of its Ravensthorpe nickel mine, in Western Australia, early in 2020. Director of exploration Mike Christie told delegates at the last day of Paydirt’s Africa Downunder conference, that production at Ravensthorpe would be ramped-up to between 20 000 t/y and 30 000 t/y of nickel over the next few years. Ravensthorpe was placed on care and maintenance in 2017 on the back of the persistent low nickel prices. At the time of placing the project on care and maintenance, First Quantum estimated that restart costs would be around $10-million.
