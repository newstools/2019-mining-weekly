Dual-listed Jubilee Metals Group on Thursday announced that the joint venture platinum group metals (PGM) recovery plant targeted for the recovery of the PGM-rich material owned through its subsidiary Windsor SA has successfully been commissioned and is fully operational. The project, which holds 1.45-million tonnes of chrome and PGM-rich material at surface with further current arisings being added, offers the potential to more than double Jubilee’s existing PGMs production and considerably enhance the company’s earnings. The project produced 1 346 oz of PGMs in its first operational month of August, which has been on-sold to a third-party refinery. To date, Jubilee has delivered 468 779 t of feed material to the PGM plant and is targeting the processing of 60 000 t of feed material for the production of 2 200 oz of PGMs in September. The grinding circuit and final flotation recovery circuits were successfully brought on line during August, which will further enhance efficiencies. The positive pricing environment for PGMs further increases the economics of this low-cost project, the company said. “With the Windsor PGM project reaching its full operational status, we have reached yet another significant milestone as we continue to grow and diversify our earnings base,” commented CEO Leon Coetzer. “I am particularly excited by the early results achieved during the commissioning phase using our tailored processing solutions, which support our expectation to achieve a consistent minimum throughput of 60 000 t/m with the potential to deliver about 2 500 oz of additional low-cost PGMs to the group per month,” he added. The Windsor PGM project is part of Jubilee’s wider project located in the western Bushveld Complex, where the company is already processing chrome at Windsor Chrome, one of South Africa’s largest chrome recovery facilities.
