PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Metallurgical coal producer Coronado Global Resources has awarded project house CIMIC Group’s mining services provider Thiess with a A$1.3-billion contract at the Curragh mine, in Queensland. The six-year contract will extend Thiess’ current operations at the mine, allowing Thiess to continue providing overburden removal and haulage, mining and run-of-mine rehandling services, equipment maintenance and pit dewatering. Coronado MD and CEO Gerry Spindler noted that this was the sixth consecutive contract that Thiess has been awarded in a competitive process, and was a testament to the company’s focus on safety and stability to achieve production objectives through operational excellence. “It also provides continuity and stability to Curragh’s northern operations while we deliver on our expansion plans,” Spindler said. In addition to this contract, Thiess will continue to deliver on its existing scope of work, including the operation and maintenance of the 1 400 t electric rope shovel and ultra-class trucking fleet.
