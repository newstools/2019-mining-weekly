TSX-V-listed exploration company Barrian Mining has signed an option agreement to acquire the Troy Canyon gold/silver project, in Nevada, from private firm Brocade Metals. The Troy Canyon project has returned historical underground stope rock grab samples assaying 576 g/t gold and 229 g/t silver. The project is located about 70 km east of Barrian's flagship Bolo project. The early-stage silver/gold project consists of 19 contiguous mineral claims that cover 158.86 ha of land centered on the historical Locke gold mine. Barrian says the Troy project has seen limited modern exploration effort, and was a former small producer. The most recent mining took place from 1948 to 1950 where 643 oz of gold and 660 oz of silver were reportedly produced from 1 859 t of mineralised rock, at an average grade of 11.83 g/t gold and 12 g/t silver.
