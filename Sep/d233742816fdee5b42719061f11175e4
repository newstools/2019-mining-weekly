Vancouver-headquartered Lucara Diamond Corp has recovered a 9.74 ct gem-quality blue diamond and a 4.13 ct gem-quality pink diamond at its Karowe mine, in Botswana. The diamonds were recovered from direct milling of South Lobe ore. This follows the recent sale of a 2.24 ct blue diamond for $347 222/ct. "Lucara is extremely pleased with the recovery of these rare, sizeable, fancy coloured diamonds, which have the potential to contribute meaningful value to our regular production of large, high-value type IIa diamonds. We look forward to offering these diamonds in our fourth-quarter tender to be held in December," says Lucara CEO Eira Thomas.
