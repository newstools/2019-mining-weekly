PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Australian Potash has signed a joint cooperation agreement with the operator and manager of the Geraldton port, in Western Australia, allowing the company to continue to optimise its logistics and port options for the Lake Wells sulphate of potash (SoP) project. “The agreement allows Australian Potash to further optimise the logistics and port options for the project, and is the first of a number of material development and operational agreements we will finalise during the front-end engineering design study,” said MD and CEO Matt Shackleton. The agreement provides for Australian Potash and Geraldton port to progress discussions on the export of SoP and the import of muriate of potash. A scoping study on the Lake Wells project previously found that it could support a Stage 1 production of 150 000 t/y, and a Stage 2 production of 300 000 t/y, over a 20-year mine life. The project is expected to cost some A$175-million for the Stage 1 development, and a further A$163-million for Stage 2.
