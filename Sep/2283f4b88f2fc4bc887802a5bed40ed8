PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The Foreign Investment Review Board has approved a A$19.5-million investment by China’s Jinan Hi-Tech into ASX-listed Triton Minerals. Triton in June this year announced the agreement, under which Jinan would subscribe for A$8.5-million shares in Triton, taking some 207.3-million shares at 4.1c apiece. Jinan would also acquire Triton shareholder Shandong Tianye Mining’s 19.3% stake in the company in a separate deal valued at A$11-million, subject to both Chinese and Australian regulatory approvals. The two transactions would give Jinan a combined shareholding of 34.01% in Triton. Triton shareholders are expected to vote on the transaction on September 27.
