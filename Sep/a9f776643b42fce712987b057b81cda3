PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Oil and gas major Santos on Thursday reported that the Barossa joint venture (JV) is one step closer to a positive final investment decision (FID), following the award of a gas export pipeline contract. The gas export pipeline will tie the Barossa gasfield, some 300 km north of Darwin, into the existing Bayu Undan to Darwin pipeline. The contract for the engineering, procurement, construction and installation of the 260-km gas export pipeline has been awarded to Allseas Group. “This is another big step towards the Barossa FID and follows the award of the subsea production system and installation support contract in May,” said Santos MD and CEO Kevin Gallagher. “Evaluation of tenders for the floating production, storage and offloading facility (FPSO) and development drilling contracts is well progressed,” he added. The Barossa project is currently in the front-end engineering design phase, which includes the FPSO facility, subsea production system and gas export pipeline. The Barossa gasfield sits within Santos’ Northern Australia portfolio, one of the company’s core long-life, natural gas asset regions. The company holds a 25% interest in the JV.
