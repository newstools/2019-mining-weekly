TSX-V-listed Giyani Metals Corporation has launched a tender process to choose a professional mining contractor for reclamation work at the K.Hill and Otse manganese projects, in Botswana. Giyani has identified six professional mining and mineral processing contractors as potential candidates for the reclamation and processing work at both sites, after the Botswana Department of Environmental Affairs approved the companyâ€™s environmental management plans. Giyani sent a request for proposal to six companies on August 5 and five preliminary responses have been received; one company decided not to bid. The companies subsequently visited the sites during the last week of August and Giyani expects to receive final proposals for the projects by the end of September. The company says the five mining contractors have a good record, both in Botswana and South Africa, as well as in neighbouring countries in the region.
