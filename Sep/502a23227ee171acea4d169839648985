PERTH (miningweekly.com) – A joint venture (JV) between Australian oil and gas major Santos, and global player BP has been awarded new acreage on trend with the Dorado discovery, offshore Western Australia. Santos will operate the new permit in the Northern Carnarvon basin, which lies to the west of the recent Dorado, Roc and Phoenix South hydrocarbon discoveries in the Bedout sub-basin. The southern portion of the permit is directly adjacent to the proven Dorado structural-stratigraphic play trend, which is interpreted to extend into the new block. Santos MD and CEO Kevin Gallagher on Friday said that Santos is committed to building its position as the leading producer of gas to the Western Australian market. “Santos is pleased to have been awarded this acreage on-trend with the Dorado discovery, a now proven world-class, liquids-rich petroleum system with high-quality reservoirs. “We are excited at the opportunity to increase our exposure to this highly prospective region, leveraging our offshore operating expertise and building on the success of our 2019 drilling campaign to pursue further growth through our activities in Western Australia. “We are proud to be the biggest producer of domestic gas in Western Australia, powering the industries that power Australia.” The newly awarded permit covers 6 964 km2 and is equally held by the JV partners.
