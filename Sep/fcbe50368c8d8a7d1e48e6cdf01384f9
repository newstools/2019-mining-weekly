PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The Western Australian Department of Mines, Industry Regulation and Safety has approved the mining proposal and mine closure plan for the Thunderbird mineral sands project. Project developer Sheffield Resources on Thursday said that the approval would allow the company to undertake mining, processing, maintenance and haulage activities during Stage 1 of the Thunderbird project, while ensuring safety, environmental and mine closure outcomes for the project were achieved. “This key approval of the mining proposal and mine closure plan is another milestone towards the development of Thunderbird. This tremendous achievement allows work to commence on site and paves the way for future construction activities,” said Sheffield MD Bruce McFadzean. During the Stage 1 operation, Thunderbird is expected to produce some 55 000 t/y of premium zircon, 77 000 t/y of zircon concentrate, and 660 000 t/y of primary ilmenite. Stage 2 of the project would see premium zircon output increase to 111 000 t/y, while zircon concentrate production would increase to 128 000 t/y and primary ilmenite production to 1.25-million tonnes a year. “It is very pleasing to finalise the mining proposal and mine closure plan for the world-class Thunderbird mineral sands project, as the company works towards securing the final portion of the project funding through various partnering and funding options available,” said McFadzean.
