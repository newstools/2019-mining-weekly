West Africa-focused Cora Gold’s recent assay results at the Sanankoro project, in Mali, have demonstrated a continuation of high-grade gold mineralisation at the 1.5-km-long Zone B prospect, one of the three main prospects. Assay drill results were received from a reverse circulation (RC) and diamond core drill programme undertaken at Zone B, completed in July. Within 100 m from surface, results include 31 m at 1.39 g/t gold, including 7 m at 3.14 g/t; 11 m at 3.27 g/t gold; 2 m at 5.46 g/t gold; and 3 m at 5.39 g/t gold. The incorporation of the new results with historical drilling increases confidence in the continuity of mineralised structure at Zone B. However, ground conditions inhibited systemic drilling along the entire structure and, as such, Zone B will be tested further in the upcoming drill programme. Historical drilling undertaken by Gold Fields – a previous owner of the permit – returned results at Zone B which include 5 m at 6.09 g/t gold; 10 m at 3.33 g/t gold; and 27 m at 1.62 g/t gold. “This latest set of drill results returned from Zone B has continued to provide strong encouragement that, in time, there is potential to define a robust gold structure through the heart of the . . . Zone B prospect,” said Cora CEO Jonathan Forster in a statement on Wednesday. “The results have provided valuable information, in particular, the core hole which confirmed the higher grades previously identified,” he added. In an upcoming drill programme, Cora intends to use a more suitable drill rig for the ground conditions, allowing greater access to the entire zone, in the hope that it will be able to demonstrate that, similarly to the Selin and Zone A prospects, there is the potential for exploitation by openpit in a future mining operation. The company’s exploration team is planning to mobilise to site at the end of the wet season, early in the fourth quarter.
