Dual-listed Cardinal Resources on Wednesday announced the appointment of mining engineer Dave Anthony as its COO for the Namdini gold project, in Ghana. Anthony, who qualified from Queen’s University in Canada, has more than three decades of experience in mining and mineral processing and has worked at senior management and executive levels globally. In 2009, he was appointed COO of Barrick Africa, which was listed on the LSE in 2010 and renamed Acacia Mining. Cardinal said that Anthony’s global experience and industry contacts would be highly valuable assets to the company as it advanced the construction of the proposed 9.5-million-tonne-a-year mine for the 5.1-million-ounce mineral ore reserve within the Namdini openpit gold deposit. Cardinal CEO and MD Archie Koimtsidis commented that Anthony’s appointment bolstered the owners’ construction team, which he would lead. “Dave has been and will continue to be, instrumental in designing and optimising the process flowsheet with Lycopodium as part of the feasibility study, which we aim to release this quarter. “We are very pleased to have a professional of Dave’s calibre leading our owner’s construction team together with our current board of highly experienced mine builders. Cardinal is focused on establishing a best in class build team with the depth of experience required to deliver this large scale and valuable project on time and on budget”.
