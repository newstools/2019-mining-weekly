The Zambian government has assured Maamba Collieries of its support and said it would look into the challenges being faced by the company to keep its 300 MW coal-fired power plant running. Zambia’s Finance Minister Dr Bwalya Ng’andu and Energy Minister Matthew Nkhuwa, respectively, visited the company’s plant in Sinazongwe this past weekend to obtain a first-hand understanding of the operations of the thermal power plant, the challenges it faces, and to discuss ways to resolve the issues between Zambia State-owned Zambia Electricity Supply Corporation, and the country’s largest independent power producer. “This plant is an enormous investment, which I think, as Zambia, we do treasure because it gives us 300 MW of power into our grid. Therefore, we have to make sure that we take care of it by making sure that we pay the bills,” said Nkhuwa. Ng’andu added that the project was long-term and that it would continue to contribute to the generation of power in the country “for many years to come”. Maamba Collieries CEO Rear Admiral Venkat Shankar, meanwhile, in thanking the Ministers, acknowledged that an “absolutely firm commitment” was there. “We are extremely conscious of the fact that the country is suffering because of the fact that our generator is down; we are extremely concerned and it is our endeavour to ensure that we reduce the difficulties of the population as early as possible,” he commented. Maamba last month reported that one of its two units was forced to shut down on October 17, 2019, owing to a technical fault which requires extensive consultations with the equipment supplier.
