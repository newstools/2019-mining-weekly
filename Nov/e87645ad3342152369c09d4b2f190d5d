The Mozambique government has approved London-listed Kenmare Resourcesâ€™ environmental, social and health impact assessment for the road to the Pilivili ore zone, near its Moma titanium mine, in Mozambique. Kenmare plans to increase its production to 1.2-million tonnes a year of ilmenite from 2021 and is, therefore, relocating its wet concentrator plant B to the high-grade Pilivili ore zone during the third quarter of next year. The impact assessment for the 23-km-long road, which includes a power line, heavy mineral concentrate pipeline and related infrastructure, was the second of two environmental approvals required for the relocation of the plant. The first approval for the Pilivili mining area was granted in May.
