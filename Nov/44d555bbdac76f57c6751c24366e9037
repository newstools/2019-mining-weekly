London-listed Eurasia Mining has appointed Alexander Sushchev as strategic adviser to the board to assist on a potential disposal of the company’s assets. Sushchev is a former CEO of SMCM – a molybdenum and rhenium metals producer that he helped sell to a company affiliated with Rusal – and a former manager of palladium producer Norilsk Nickel. Eurasia noted that Sushchev would not receive a salary for his role, but that he would receive a 10% share in Deloan Investments, a company owned and controlled by Eurasia director Dmitry Suschov. Deloan holds 10.42% of Eurasia. "I am delighted to formalise our relationship with Alexander, whom I have known for many years. We have been fortunate to have his advice for over ten years and he has made the tasks of licensing our projects much easier. His contacts and experience working at the top level of the PGM and base metals businesses are important in our ongoing discussions, as we explore strategic opportunities for our assets,” said chairperson Christian Schaffalitzky.
