Dual-listed Kirkland Lake had a record third quarter and is rewarding shareholders with a 50% increase to its quarterly dividend to be paid in January next year. The high-grade gold miner reported record net earnings of $176.6-million, or $0.84 a share, which was more than triple the net earnings of $55.9-million, or $0.27 a share, in the third quarter of 2019, and 69% higher than the $104.2-million, or $0.50 a share, of the previous quarter. Adjusted net earnings were the same as net earnings and increased by 188% from $61.4-million in the September 2018 quarter, and by 67% from $105.5-million in the June 2019 quarter. Kirkland boosted its revenue by 71% year-on-year to $381.4-million, while operating cash flow surged 145% and free cash flow tripled to $181.3-million. With strong financial results and a growing cash position, Kirkland continued to increase the amount of capital it returned to shareholders. The mining firm announced a 50% increase in the common share dividend to $0.06 a share, effective in the fourth quarter. “This will be the fifth increase in the dividends since it was introduced in March 2017. Higher dividend payments support our efforts to generate strong returns for shareholders. We continue to have considerable success with our share price also up about over 70% year-to-date in 2019,” said Kirkland president and CEO Tony Makuch. The miner increased its production by 38% year-on-year to 248 400 oz in the quarter, at an all-in sustaining cost of $562/oz, which is a 13% improvement on that of a year earlier.
