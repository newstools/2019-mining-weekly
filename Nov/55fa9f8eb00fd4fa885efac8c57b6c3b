The Lusaka High Court has granted the board of Konkola Copper Mines (KCM) and Vedanta Resources an injunction order, preventing the sale of the KCM mining right areas by KCM provincial liquidator Milingo Lungu. The court order comes after Vedanta and KCM became aware of the liquidator having entered into a consent judgment in Zambia’s court of appeal, which would result in KCM’s sale of Lot 649/M Chingola for $20-million to three companies with whom KCM had been in a legal dispute over the area since 2016. The three companies are Rephidim, Mimbula and Moxico Resources Zambia. Vedanta and KCM said it would continue to protect KCM’s assets through all available legal remedies.
