CSE-listed exploration company Rockcliff Metals on Wednesday announced that the initial drill holes at the Talbot property, in which it is earning a stake from base metals miner Hudbay Minerals, have delivered high-grade assay results. Drilling intersected mineralisation above the current Talbot deposit resource and within the existing Talbot deposit resource envelope. Significant assays include 0.71% copper equivalent (CuEq) across 11.6 m including 2.3% CuEq across 0.5 m, 0.79% CuEq across 13.9 m including 2.1% CuEq across 1.2 m, 6.0% CuEq across 18.3 m, including 10.4% CuEq across 4.8 m and 0.94% CuEq across 23.7 m, including 3.2% CuEq across 2.0 m and 2.0% CuEq across 2.1 m. "Our first assays from this drill programme at Talbot have confirmed additional mineralisation outside and above the Talbot deposit. Additionally, the fact that drill hole TB024 is the highest-grade mineralisation encountered nearest to surface to date is extremely encouraging,” commented president and CEO Alistair Ross. Rockcliff is planning a drill programme of at least 22 000 m at Talbot, in the Snow Lake area of Manitoba. To date, 14 holes have been drilled and four are in progress for a total of 10 186 m. This current round of drilling will result in Rockcliff earning an initial 51% ownership interest in the Talbot project from Hudbay. The Talbot project hosts the Talbot copper deposit – a high-grade 4.2-million-tonne inferred mineral resource grading 1.61% copper, 1.4% zinc, 1.77 g/t gold and 27.96 g/t gold. The Talbot property drilling is part of Rockcliff's 100 000-m drill programme under way in the Snow Lake area. The Talbot deposit is located within trucking distance to the company's leased 1 000 t/d mill and tailings facility. Shares in Rockcliff surged 18% to C$0.095 apiece on Wednesday.
