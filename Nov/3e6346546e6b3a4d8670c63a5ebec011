TSX-listed Teranga Gold is edging closer to attaining midtier status with its second mine, Wahgnion, now in commercial production. The new mine, in Burkina Faso, is expected to achieve the upper end of its 2019 production guidance of 30 000 oz to 40 000 oz of gold after achieving first pour ahead of schedule in late August. “The Wahgnion plant is running at or above nameplate capacity, recovery rates are well above 90%, and costs are tracking in line with our 2019 guidance. With the successful ramp up to commercial production, Wahgnion is expected to finish the year at the upper end of its production guidance for 2019,” said COO Paul Chawrun. Teranga has a consolidated guidance of 245 000 oz to 270 000 oz for 2019. “Now that we have achieved commercial production, in the new year our attention will turn to conducting a reserve development programme focused on optimising the mine plan and adding reserves to extend the current 13-year mine life,” Chawrun added in a news release. Wahgnion is forecast to produce 132 000 oz/y at an all-in sustaining cost of $761/oz in the first five years of its current 13-year mine life. Wahgnion is Teranga’s second gold operation after the Sabodala mine, in Senegal.
