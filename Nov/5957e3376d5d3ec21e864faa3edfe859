Environmental and advisory solutions firm SLR Consulting South Africa has invited public comment into the environmental-impact assessment (EIA) for the proposed construction of a new zinc smelter and associated infrastructure at the Gamsberg zinc mine’s Phase 1 concentrator plant. Black Mountain Mining (BMM), part of Vedanta Zinc International, owns and operates the Gamsberg zinc mine, in South Africa’s Northern Cape province. The smelter will beneficiate the between 250 000 t/y and 300 000 t/y of zinc concentrate, producing 99% pure special high-grade zinc metal for metal export. Additionally, the smelter will produce 99% sulphuric acid as a by-product for export and domestic consumption. BMM is working to secure environmental authorisation and a waste management licence from the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy, as well as an atmospheric emissions licence and water-use licence. In addition to the smelter, it also plans to build a new 39-km-long bulk water pipeline from the existing Orange river abstraction point to the Gamsberg site to replace the old underground pipeline. The existing Pella Water Works will also be upgraded. The new pipeline will supply the increased potable water demand as a result of the smelter development and will be built within the old underground pipeline servitude. A separate water-use licence application and basic assessment are being undertaken for the upgraded Pella Bulk Water Pipeline. BMM has appointed SLR as the independent environmental assessment practitioner to undertake the necessary assessments and facilitate a public participation process for the project. SLR will hold public meetings on the matter in Aggeneys, Pella and Pofadder from December 2 to 4.
