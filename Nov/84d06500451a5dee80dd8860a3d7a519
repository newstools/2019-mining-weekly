PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Theta Gold Mines has dual listed on the OTCQB market in the US, with the company trading under the code TGMGF. The company on Friday said that the US listing was sought to provide current and potential North American investors with the appropriate accessibility and liquidity to invest in the company, with the dual listing providing Theta with access to one of the largest investment markets in the world, at nominal cost, with no additional compliance requirements, compared to traditional major exchanges. “An OTCQB listing provides Theta with access to the world’s largest investment market. Key South African gold miners, including Harmony, Sibanye and AngloGold Ashanti all have US main board listing status,” said Theta chairperson Bill Guy. “Theta is at a critical stage of its development and we are excited to be broadening our exposure in the global investment community. Joining the OTCQB market will be matched with an active investor engagement programme, to ensure our investment attractions and growth prospects are highlighted with new investors.” Theta’s namesake gold project, in South Africa, is estimated to require a capital investment of $34.3-million, and is slated to produce more than 200 000 oz of gold over a five-year period, at an all-in sustaining cost of $764/oz.
