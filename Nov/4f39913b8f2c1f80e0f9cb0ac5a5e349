The partners in the Hook Lake project, in Saskatchewan's Athabasca basin, have approved an exploration budget of C$2-million for 2020, with exploration set to begin this winter. The Hook Lake project is a joint venture (JV) between Cameco (39.5%), Orano Canada (39.5%) and Purepoint (21%) in the Patterson uranium district, which hosts Fission Uranium's Triple R deposit and NexGen's Arrow deposit. The approved 2020 exploration programme would include 3 500 m of diamond drilling, about seven holes, and a geophysical survey, Toronto-listed Purepoint reported on Tuesday. The diamond drilling would continue to test high-priority targets along the Patterson corridor including a conductive shear on trend between the Spitfire Zone and the Dragon area, follow-up testing of the Hornet Zone conductor, and new geophysical targets along the "W" conductor. Purepoint said that a ground electromagnetic survey would be conducted over the Patterson corridor, along the "W" conductor, northeast of the encouraging drill hole HK19-105. Fission's Triple R deposit has an indicated mineral resource of 87.76-million pounds of U3O8 at an average grade of 1.82% U3O8 and NexGen Energy's Arrow deposit has an indicated mineral resource of 256.6-million pounds at an average grade of 4.03%.
