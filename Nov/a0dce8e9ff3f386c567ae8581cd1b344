PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Trial mining has started at the Maniry graphite project, in Madagascar, ASX-listed Black Earth Minerals has reported. Mining and excavation activities will be completed by late November, with the more than 60 t bulk sample going to Beijing General Research Institute of Mining and Metallurgy in early January 2020. Black Earth MD Tom Revy on Wednesday said that the company continues to meet the milestones required to progress from a graphite developer to producer. “With 250 kg of Maniry concentrate already in China and testing to commence shortly, the further 60 t of bulk material currently being mined will be shipped to China as part of the Stage 2 large scale pilot plant progamme, which will provide valuable information and data to the company. “Black Earth continues to take consistent steps towards formalising binding offtake agreements and the completion of the bankable feasibility study. We look forward to continuing to advance the Maniry graphite project over the coming period.” The proposed development of the Maniry project would take place in two stages, with the project expected to have a mine life of ten years. The $41-million Stage 1 operation is expected to produce around 30 000 t/y of graphite over the first three years of operation, while a further $29-million in capital investment would increase output to 60 000 t/y from year four onwards.
