The mine design for investment group Armadale Capital's Mahenge Liandu graphite project, in Tanzania, is being finalised, following a site visit by the project engineer. The mine design, which will be optimised to ensure high-grade areas are targeted first, will be included in a definitive feasibility study (DFS) for the project. Aim-listed Armadale on Monday noted that all assumptions for the DFS had been stress tested and verified and that the project engineer had reviewed the site layout to garner a primary understanding of the logistics, terrain and route to market. Meetings have also been held with mining contractors, third-party suppliers and logistics operators to ensure a seamless route to transport graphite concentrate from the mine to port. “Over the past six months, significant progress has been made defining a high-grade resource, completing memorandums of understanding and progressing the commercialisation strategy. With our funding position now secure, the board is delighted to continue progressing Armadale’s ongoing transition from explorer to emerging producer. 
 
“The site visit by the project engineer tasked with designing the mine is a key milestone as it signifies the concept is moving towards reality and is an important step as we finalise the project’s DFS.  We are now looking beyond the completion of the DFS to focus on the commercialisation strategy in order to deliver a high-quality graphite product to our off-take partners. As part of this process, the board has been increasingly focused on project infrastructure and ensuring all the elements necessary to commence mining operations in a timely manner are in place," Armadale director Nick Johansen commented.
