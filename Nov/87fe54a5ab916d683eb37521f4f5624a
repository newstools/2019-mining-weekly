PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Graphite miner Syrah Resources has announced the first production of purified spherical graphite from its battery anode material (BAM) plant, in the US. Syrah on Monday said that the first purified spherical graphite, produced from natural graphite sourced from the Balama operation, in Mozambique, was a significant milestone for the BAM project, and the execution of the company’s strategy to develop a vertically integrated natural graphite anode material production capability. “The Balama graphite operation’s expected scale, quality and low production cost at full capacity are key enablers in the delivery of Syrah’s integrated BAM strategy,” said MD and CEO Shaun Verner. “With the completion of construction and commissioning activities for initial production of purified spherical graphite from Vidalia in the US, we are demonstrating a pathway to produce value-added products at commercial scale, focused on establishing a core position in the battery supply chain.” Verner said that the first production of purified spherical graphite demonstrated Syrah’s commitment to develop the first large-scale fully integrated natural graphite anode material production facility outside of China. “The dispatch of BAM precursor products from our Vidalia plant for customer testing and qualification activity is a critical driver of meaningful industry engagement. From now and into 2020, we will continue to focus on customer development and strategic partnership opportunities through the qualification process and by progressing production of anode active material for further customer engagement.” Syrah was earlier this year forced to undertake a structural review of the company, on the back of falling flake graphite procures, which resulted in a 30% reduction in staff numbers at Balama, and a decision to reduce its production in the fourth quarter of this year, and into 2020, allowing the natural graphite market to rebalance. Graphite production during the fourth quarter will be dropped by around 5 000 t a month, while production for 2020 is currently planned at between 120 000 t and 150 000 t, subject to market conditions.
