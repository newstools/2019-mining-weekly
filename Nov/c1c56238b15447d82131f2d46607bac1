Nordic-focused explorer Beowulf Mining has submitted a concluding statement for the Kallak North iron-ore project to the Swedish government, outlining the reasons the company believes it should be awarded the concession. The statement does not submit any new facts in the Kallak case, but summarises the circumstances relevant to a judicial review of whether Beowulf should be awarded the exploitation concession for Kallak.

The statement notes that neither the reindeer herding impact assessment, nor the environmental impact assessment have concluded that mining operations at Kallak would threaten the existence and livelihoods of local reindeer herding communities. It also outlines the positive impact that a mine would have on the local community. Furthermore, the statement highlights the similarities between Kallak and available case law, which support the approval of the concession.
 
“I note that, the Fröberg & Lundholm and Mannheimer Swartling law firms have found no new facts pertaining to the application for an exploitation concession. The case was made in the company’s final detailed submission to government in February 2018 and over the last 6.5 years. “The statement’s conclusion, that sufficient facts have been submitted for awarding Beowulf the concession, speaks for itself. 

“The company and its shareholders have endured delay after delay, and if, as stated by the government, Swedish law is sufficient for assessing the Kallak application, and the assessment should be ‘by the book’, then we hope that this statement will enable the government to also conclude that a concession should be awarded,” says CEO Kurt Budge.
