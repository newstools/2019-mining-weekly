PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Mineral sands miner Image Resources has struck sales agreements for 65 000 t of heavy mineral concentrate (HMC) for the December quarter, with no reduction in zircon pricing. Image told shareholders that while the benchmark pricing for premium grade zircon decreased by 2.5% in November, Image’s sales price for standard-grade zircon contained in the HMC remained unchanged for its scheduled November and December shipments. In addition, the company’s realised price for titanium dioxide contained in the HMC increased by around 6% in August, and this higher price has continued in the December quarter. “We continue to receive robust demand for our zircon-rich HMC product. The committed sales of 65 000 t in the December quarter, at stable zircon pricing, keeps the company firmly on track to deliver on our updated 2019 guidance,” said Image MD and CEO Patrick Mutz.
