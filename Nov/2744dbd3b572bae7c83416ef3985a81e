Canada-headquartered exploration company Rise Gold has submitted an application for a use permit for the historic Idaho-Maryland (IM) gold mine, in Nevada, US. The IM mine was the second-largest lode gold producer in the US before its forced closure during World War II. In the two years before its closure – 1940 and 1941 – the mine production averaged 920 t/d with a mill head grade of 12.9 g/t and 121 000 oz/y of gold production. The use permit application proposes to restart underground mining at an average throughput of 1 000 t/d. The existing Brunswick shaft, which extends to about 3 400 ft depth below the surface, will be used as the primary rock conveyance. A second service shaft will be constructed by raising from underground to provide for the conveyance of personnel, materials, and equipment. Rise Gold recently completed 67 500 ft (about 20 600 m) of exploration core drilling at the IM mine, with high-grade gold intercepts having been encountered, near the existing mine workings and to depths significantly below historic mining areas. The company believes it drilling programme has been successful, but cautions that no current mineral resources or mineral reserves have been defined. It has also not completed a feasibility study to establish mineral reserves and has not made a production decision for the mine.
