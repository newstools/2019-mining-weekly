TSX- and NYSE-listed Pretium Resources (Pretivm), which owns the Brucejack mine in British Columbia, has bolstered its board with the appointment of two high-profile directors who have extensive mining experience. Former Newmont Mining president and CEO Richard O’Brien, who is also a past CEO of Boart Longyear, joined the board and will assume the role of chairperson, following the retirement of Robert Quartermain at the end of next month. The miner also appointed former Rio Tinto COO at Kennecott Utah copper mine, Jeane Hull, to its board. “I am very pleased to welcome Richard and Jeane to the board. They both bring extensive industry experience at this important juncture in the company’s evolution that will complement the skill sets of our directors,” said outgoing chairperson Quartermain. “It has been a great personal privilege to have been involved with Pretivm from exploration through to its development as a profitable midtier gold producer. As incoming chair, Richard brings a depth of understanding of the gold business that will be instrumental in helping the board steward Pretivm to its next level of success for shareholders.”
