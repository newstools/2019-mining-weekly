PERTH (miningweekly.com) – An 820-km seismic survey to scope out the potential for new gas, liquids and other mineral resources in the Northern Territory’s Barkly region would conclude this week, federal Resources and Northern Australia Minister Matt Canavan said. The survey is being conducted on ground which has seen little exploration in the past, and will fill in the ‘missing link’ between Mount Isa in Queensland and the Beetaloo sub-basin in the Northern Territory, Canavan said. “The Beetaloo sub-basin to the North of this region has the potential to deliver 178 000 PJ of shale gas, which is larger than any of the North West Shelf conventional gas resources. It’s exciting to have a region that could promise the same potential resources,” Canavan said. “Over 25 years a moderate scale of onshore gas development in the Northern Territory could create more than 6 500 jobs and be worth more than A$9-billion nationally. “Mines in the Barkly region already contribute A$17-million annually to the Australian economy and the mining industry in the Northern Territory employs 4 500 people. With this new data, we could expand this significantly and create more jobs for Northern Australia.” Northern Territory Minister for Primary Industry and Resources Paul Kirby said recent industry interest in the Beetaloo area, including new drilling activity, showed the areas have huge potential. “Since we lifted the moratorium on fracking in the Northern Territory, we’ve seen significant industry interest in the South Nicholson basin and the Beetaloo sub-basin, including recent commitments into frontier acreage,” Kirby said. “Just this year, around 13 000 km2 of new exploration licence applications have been made by industry over previous vacant ground in the Barkly area - this creates jobs and is good for the local economy.” The survey will be released in the first half of 2020.
