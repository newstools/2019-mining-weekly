Platinum group metals (PGMs) miner Royal Bafokeng Platinum (RBPlat) has concluded a five-year wage agreement with its permanent employees, who are represented by the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM). The agreement, which is effective from July 1, this year, provides for increases in all major components of remuneration over the next five years. This includes salary increases of 7% in years one, four and five of the agreement and increases of 6% in years two and three of the agreement. Further, employees whose remuneration falls below the entry-level minimum wage after the application of the above increases, will receive further upward salary adjustments. RBPlat on Monday said the wage deal had been achieved through a collaborative process "exemplified by mutual respect between RBPlat and the NUM". It added that the agreement provided the company with five years of stability. "The company acknowledges with appreciation to the union the maturity with which these very difficult negotiations were conducted. The agreement removes substantial uncertainty for our employees into the future and allows the companyâ€™s employees to remain focused on safety and productivity. "Both parties are committed to working towards ensuring a sustainable business that will create long-term value for all our stakeholders," the PGMs miner stated.
