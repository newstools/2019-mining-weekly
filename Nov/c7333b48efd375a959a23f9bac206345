TSX-V-listed Golden Predator Mining is fast-tracking a feasibility study for Phase 1 of its plans to reopen the Brewery Creek gold mine, near Dawson City, Yukon. US-based Kappes, Cassiday and Associates has been retained to complete the study for Phase 1, which envisions the reprocessing of the original heap leach pad. It is thought that about 10-million tonnes of run-of-mine ore were placed on the heap leach pad between 1996 and 2002 at an average grade of 1.5 g/t gold containing about 525 094 oz of gold. Refinery records state that 277 170 oz were produced from the heap leach pad. The feasibility study will focus solely on remediating and reprocessing the heap leach pad as a means of fast-tracking revenue and development of the site for mining. The study should be completed by the first quarter of next year, said CEO Janet Lee-Sheriff. Phase 2 involves restarting the mining and processing of new material along the lines of the full-scale original project, while Phase 3 involves the possible expansion of the project to process additional material not included in the original project, reflecting Golden Predator’s exploration successes since 2012. Licences are in place for Phase 1 and Phase 2.  For Phase 3, Golden Predator has begun preparation of amendments to be filed early in the new year to incorporate additional resources into the current mine plan through the assessment and licensing process to extend the anticipated mine life, Lee-Sheriff noted. “The feasibility study represents a major step towards commercial production and with the significant infrastructure left in place, a cost effective means to a restart of the larger operation.”
