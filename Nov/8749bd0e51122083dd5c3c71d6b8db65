PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Bass Metals has reported record monthly shipments from its Graphmada mine, in Madagascar. The company this week said that a record 809 t of graphite was shipped during October, setting a new monthly record. The company had a further 560 t of forward sales committed to be shipped by the end of the December quarter, leaving Bass well placed to receive material cash flows from the December quarter. The record monthly shipments followed on from a record quarter during the three months to September, in which 1 128 t of graphite was produced at Graphmada. Bass was also able to complete its first and substantial sale of graphite concentrates into the Chinese market during the month of October, with the miner expecting subsequent shipments in November. “We are delighted with the team’s efforts in progressively broadening our customer base and exceptionally pleased that our concentrates are being recognised as consistent in quality and Bass as a reliable supplier,” said Bass CEO Tim McManus.
