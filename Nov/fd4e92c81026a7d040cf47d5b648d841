Dual-listed Bluejay Mining has appointed a “well regarded and recognised Greenland expert” to lead its exploration efforts in that country as it moves to advance the Disko-Nuussuaq and Kangerluarsuk projects. The company announced on Tuesday that the former chief geologist of Greenland’s State-sponsored exploration company NunaMinerals, Joshua Hughes, had joined its team in a newly created position of exploration manager. Hughes, who Bluejay said had extensive knowledge on Greenlandic geology and its mineral potential, would manage multiple interrelated exploration programmes. “Our model of populating the team with highly experienced professionals ensures success at all levels, and I am delighted that he has agreed to join us on this exciting journey,” said Bluejay CEO Roderick McIllree. “The country remains vastly underexplored, so Josh's experience is invaluable as Bluejay continues in the search and evaluation of further opportunities. Next year promises to be the most exciting to date as we move to finally drill test two massive base metal projects that are currently 100% owned by Bluejay." Hughes commented that he was delighted to join the team at Bluejay, which he regarded as leaders in exploration and discovery in Greenland. "The rapid advancement of the Dundas ilmenite project, at a speed which is unparalleled by Greenland standards, demonstrates the company's dynamic exploration strategy. I am confident that we can repeat this success at Disko-Nuussuaq and Kangerluarsuk as we prepare for maiden drill programmes to test these two exceptional and compelling base metal projects.”
