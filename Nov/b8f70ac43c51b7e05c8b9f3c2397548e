Investment fund Zeta Resources on Friday said it did not intend to accept nickel miner Independence Group's hostile A$312-million ($214.6-million) takeover bid for Panoramic Resources. Zeta Resources is managed by Bermuda-based hedge fund ICM, which holds a 34.7% majority stake in Panoramic. "The offer was unsolicited, and in the opinion of Zeta Resources, opportunistic," the company said in a statement. On Monday, Independence made an all-scrip offer for the 96.2% of shares in smaller peer Panoramic Resources Ltd it does not already own, pitching the bid at a steep 42% premium. Independence is looking to increase its exposure to nickel given demand for new energy metals and amid an expected boom in batteries for electric vehicles. Independence Group was not immediately able to comment on the matter.
