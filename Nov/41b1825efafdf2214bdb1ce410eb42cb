Emerging gold mining company Monarch has acquired 24 claims covering about 5 km2, immediately west of its Wasamac property in Quebec. The initial purpose of the acquisition was to secure the location of Wasamac’s future mining infrastructure, but Monarch CEO Jean-Marc Lacoste says a closer look at the new property revealed that it may have “interesting exploration potential”. “In fact, the fault that hosts the Wasamac deposit seems to extend onto the property, which has not been the subject of work in this area. In addition, the main envelope of the Wasamac deposit lies about 500 m from the property boundary, which makes the property even more interesting,” he said on Wednesday. Monarch would conduct a preliminary exploration programme to better assess its gold potential. As consideration for this acquisition, Monarch issued one-million common shares of its share capital to Gwen Resources and will pay the private company a total of $150 000 in cash, consisting of $75 000 on closing of the transaction and $75 000 six months after closing. Gwen will also be entitled to a 2.5% net smelter return (NSR) on the property. Monarch may buy back a 1.25% NSR for $2-million in cash. Monarch recently filed a project notice with the Quebec government for its Wasamac project, marking the first step in the mining permit application process, which generally takes 18 to 24 months. Located about 15 km west of Rouyn-Noranda in the Abitibi-Témiscamingue region, Wasamac is forecast to produce an average of 142 000 oz/y over an 11-year mine life at an all-in sustaining cost of C$826/oz. The company intends to make Wasamac a Mining 4.0 project, combining new technologies and respect for the environment.
