Canada’s Group Eleven announced on Thursday that John Barry, cofounder and VP for exploration and strategy, has stepped down from his position and resigned as director of various Irish subsidiaries with immediate effect. In an announcement, Barry said that after 32 years of exploring for metals on five continents, it was time for him to pursue other ideas outside of mining and mineral exploration. He will keep some involvement in the sector through independent consulting. "As a co-founder of Group Eleven back in 2015 and subsequently chairman of the company before its IPO [initial public offering] in December 2017, it has been good to work with such a talented team of highly experienced geologists and to see the company establish an unrivalled exploration portfolio in a world-class zinc district.” Barry would remain a major shareholder of Group Eleven, which is searching for “the next big zinc deposit” in Ireland.
