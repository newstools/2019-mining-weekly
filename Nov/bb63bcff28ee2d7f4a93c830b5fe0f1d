PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Junior miner Beacon Minerals has officially opened its Juardi gold mine, in Western Australia, after the project poured its first gold in September. The A$21.4-million project is expected to recover some 126 000 oz of gold over a five-year mine life, generating life-of-mine revenues of around A$208.5-million and surplus operating cash flows of A$98.4-million at a gold price of A$1 650/oz. The project, located 35 km north-west of Coolgardie, is slated to process 500 000 t/y of ore and add about 25 000 oz to Western Australia's annual gold sales tally. "This project has progressed quickly, taking only 20 months between ore discovery and final approvals, demonstrating the strength of Western Australia's world leading approvals processes,” said Western Australian Mines and Petroleum Minister Bill Johnston. "The government, through initiatives such as Streamline Western Australia and Machinery of Government changes, continues to provide improvements to our State's efficient and effective regulatory system. "The government supports mining exploration through the state government's popular Exploration Incentive Scheme co-funded drilling programme, and supplying pre-competitive geological data,” the Minister said. The Juardi mine and processing plant employed 60 workers during construction and will have an operational workforce of 40.
