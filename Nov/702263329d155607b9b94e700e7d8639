Chilean copper miner Antofagasta on Monday provided a new production guidance for 2019, following the recent unrest and riots, which disrupted supplies to its Los Pelambres mine and resulted in damage to equipment. All its mines are now back in operation, but the London-listed mining company said that the disruptions were estimated to have an impact of about 10 000 t of copper for the full year. It previously guided a 5 000 t impact. Further, at Antucoya, labour negotiations had been successfully concluded with the union ending the strike which started on October 16. The impact on copper production was estimated at about 4 000 t. Antofagasta reported that its full-year production was expected to be between 750 000 t and 770 000 t, from a previous guidance of 750 000 t to 790 000 t.
