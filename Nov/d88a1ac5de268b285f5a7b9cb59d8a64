Aim-listed W Resources has started commercial production of tungsten and tin concentrate at its flagship La Parilla mine, in Spain, marking an important stage in the T2 ramp-up phase. The commercial production sets the company on track towards achieving its target two-million tonnes a year run-of-mine (RoM), to produce 2 000 t of tungsten trioxide (WO3) concentrate. Chairperson Michael Masterman reported that W was pleased with the initial concentrate production grades. The grades should improve as the operation ramped up and transitioned to 24-hour plant operations in December. The plant is currently running on day shifts. Mining and crushing operations are fully operational. On Monday, W completed its latest blast at La Parrilla of 90 000 t of ore and rock – its largest to date – providing significant inventory of ore feed. La Parrilla is a tungsten and tin mine with a 49-million-tonne resource, grading 998 parts per million (ppm) WO3 and reserves of 29.8-million tonnes, at a diluted grade of 931 ppm WO3. Production started in December 2018 and the mine is currently in the ramp-up phase to mine two-million tonnes a year of RoM.
