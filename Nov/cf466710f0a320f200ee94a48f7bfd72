Vancouver-headquartered Lundin Gold has received the two outstanding permits that were required to move its Fruta del Norte project, in Ecuador, into production. With the issue of an industrial water permit and administrative act, the company would achieve its goal of producing its first gold before the end of this year. Lundin noted that the process plant had been in the hot commissioning phase for about a month. The $692-million Fruta del Norte project will be Ecuador’s biggest gold mine, producing an average of 310 000 oz/y at a projected all-in sustaining cost of $583/oz.
