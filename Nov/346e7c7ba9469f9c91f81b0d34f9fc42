PERTH (miningweekly.com) â€“ Uranium developer Aura Energy on Wednesday told shareholders that it has started a broad-based process of cost management, which will include staff reductions. Aura said that the hours of head office staff would be reduced, while all services from all technical and consultant staff would be suspended. Director payments will also be suspended, while staff costs in both Mauritania and Sweden would also be reduced. The majority of these initiatives were put in place during August and September, the company said.
