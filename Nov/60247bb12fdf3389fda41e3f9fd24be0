The Brazilian Environmental Department, or Supram, has issued Aim-listed Harvest Minerals the full environmental permit for the company’s Arapua remineraliser project. The permit allows Harvest to mine and process up to 400 000 t/y, which can be further increased when required. In addition, the company has been granted permission to further increase the size of the run-of-mine (RoM) storage areas and clear some other areas to assist production as required. The award of the full mining permit by the Agência Nacional de Mineração is expected to follow in due course. “As a producer of an organic product, we are very aware of environmental considerations. Sustainability is a key consideration for Harvest and we aim to have minimal environmental impact. Our production facilities don't use any water, nor produce any waste,” said executive chairperson Brian McMaster. In addition to the environmental considerations, the permit allows Harvest to produce at a rate above current nameplate capacity. “As we announced recently, we are increasing production areas in anticipation of next year and beyond and having the environmental consent to move forward is very important,” noted McMaster. The company recently increased the size of the current openpit by stripping the soil cover from an area of about 6 000 m2 and exposing 70 000 t of weathered kamafugite, which is being mined using the company's own equipment. Owing to the heavily weathered nature of the ore, it required no blasting and was simply being loaded onto trucks by a loader to be taken to the RoM storage area. As part of this work, a new RoM storage area has been created adjacent to the pit. Harvest produces KPFértil, a multi-nutrient direct application natural remineraliser, at its Arapua project.
