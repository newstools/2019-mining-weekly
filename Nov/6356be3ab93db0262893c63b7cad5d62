PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Construction has started on a hydrogen energy supply chain (HESC) pilot project, in Victoria. Brown coal from the Latrobe Valley will be turned into hydrogen gas as part of the world-first HESC pilot. The hydrogen gas will then be transported to Port of Hastings where it will be liquified and shipped to Japan for use in fuel cell vehicles and power generation. The pilot project will include the demonstration of brown coal gasification and gas-refining, hydrogen liquefaction, shipbuilding and operation of a specialised liquefied hydrogen carrier, as well as the identification of a future commercilisation pathway for the commercial phase of a hydrogen supply chain. Victorian Economic Development Minister Tim Pallas said that the HESC pilot would boost local industry knowledge and expertise in the production and use of hydrogen, while also boosting jobs. This has the potential to put Victoria at the forefront of the fast-growing hydrogen industry, which is expected to be worth A$2.5-trillion globally by 2050. The pilot is expected to create 400 jobs in the Latrobe Valley and Hastings regions across the life of the project, with the potential for thousands more if the project proceeds to the commercial phase. “We are proud to back this world-first first project which will put Victoria at the forefront of the global hydrogen industry,” the Minister said. “The government is growing jobs and industry in the Latrobe Valley and working with our partners in Japan as we transition to a low carbon energy future.”
