London-listed Petra Diamonds has sold a 20.08 ct blue diamond, recovered at its Cullinan mine, in South Africa, in September, for $14.9-million. This represents a value of about $741 000/ct. "We are very pleased with this result, which is in line with our expectations and confirms the resilience in the value of very high-quality blue diamonds, undoubtedly one of nature's rarest treasures. We look forward to following this exceptional stone's journey to its polished form," CEO Richard Duffy commented on Friday.
