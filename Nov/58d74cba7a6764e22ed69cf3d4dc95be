The most recent work programme at West Africa-focused gold explorer Cora Gold’s Sanankoro gold discovery, in the Yanfolila gold belt, in southern Mali, has confirmed the potential for higher gold grades at multiple zones. The work programme was undertaken from May to September. CEO Jonathan Forster on Monday said the programme at Sanankoro was targeted at providing greater confidence to support the exploration target of between one- and two-million ounces of gold to a vertical depth of 100 m. He added that the work had generated positive results which consistently demonstrated the continuity of the mineralisation with economic potential. Cora also drilled some deeper holes that intersected mineralisation up to 170 m deep to establish new exploration targets within the sulphides. "We believe the scale of the structure at Sanankoro is substantial given that drilling to date has only focused on oxides over less than 20% of the potential mineralised structures on the permit area,” Forster commented. Cora now looks to advance its fourth-quarter work programme to support this belief. With the company having raised nearly £2-million in September, Forster confirmed that Cora is “well-funded to fast-track these programmes”.
