TSX-listed Prophecy Development has applied for the primary mining permits governing construction, operation and closure for its Gibellini vanadium project, in Eureka county, Nevada. The company believes that the deposit is critical, as Gibellini’s production profile of 9.75-million pounds a year of vanadium pentoxide is sufficient to meet US current vanadium consumption requirement. The permit applications, submitted to the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection (NDEP) with copies provided to the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the Gibellini project environmental impact statement (EIS) contractor SWCA, were for the water pollution control permit and the class II air quality permit. Prophecy says that the Nevada state permits have been developed to provide construction level engineering that supports the mine plan previously submitted to the BLM in the plan of operations. The company notes that comments received from the BLM and SWCA were used as guidance in the engineering design to ensure the state and federal permits are aligned and reflect the most current guidance provided by both the NDEP and BLM. “The Prophecy team is working diligently with the support of the federal and state regulators and is actively engaging all stakeholders in order to obtain all the state and federal permits required to begin construction of North America’s first primary vanadium mine. We are on track to initiate the EIS process after the notice of intent is published, which will be a milestone in permitting the Gibellini project,” notes Ron Espell, VP environment and sustainability. “It will represent the starting point of a well-defined 12-month process under the Department of the Interior’s Secretarial Order No. 3355 that shareholders will be able to mark on their calendars.”
