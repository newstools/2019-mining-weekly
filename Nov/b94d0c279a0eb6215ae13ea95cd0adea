MOSCOW - Russia's biggest gold producer, Polyus, said on Tuesday it was significantly increasing its capital expenditure (capex) plans for 2020 compared with earlier forecasts. "I will not give you a precise number but what I can tell you is that taking into account the spillover of capex from 2019 to 2020... there will be a significant increase in capex of the group versus the previous guidance in 2020," CFO Mikhail Stiskin said on a call with analysts.
