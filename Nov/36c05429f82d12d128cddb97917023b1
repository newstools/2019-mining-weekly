Diversified miner Vedanta Resources on Friday said it was "deeply concerned" about reports of a sulphur dioxide leak at the Nchanga smelter acid plant owned by Konkola Copper Mines (KCM), in Zambia. It noted that reports have emerged that KCM employees and pupils attending the nearby Nchanga Trust School were hospitalised as a result. Vedanta has not had access to any of KCM’s facilities since the provisional liquidator Milingo Lungu was appointed on May 21. Vedanta said it had, on several occasions in the six months since then, attempted to engage with Lungu on areas of concern, especially as regards issues of safety and maintenance at KCM’s facilities.
