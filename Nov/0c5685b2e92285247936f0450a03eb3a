Iron-ore pellets producer Ferrexpo on Thursday named Roman Palyvoda as acting chief financial officer with immediate effect, replacing Chris Mawe who took up the top job on an interim basis last month. The Ukraine-focused company said last month Kostyantin Zhevago was temporarily stepping down as chief executive officer to resolve matters related to one of his former businesses in Ukraine. Palyvoda joined Ferrexpo in 2008 as the group management accountant and previously worked at Renault Group for over five years.
