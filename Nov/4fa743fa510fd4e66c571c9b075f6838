PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The first round of results from ASX-listed FYI Resources’ high purity alumina (HPA) pilot plant trial has achieved grades of 99.99%, the company said on Wednesday. The plant operated continuously from October 2 to 9 on a 24/7 basis, and either met or exceeded the modelled operational performances, demonstrating the potential for commercial production of a HPA, the company previously said. “We are very pleased with the initial round of pilot plant results which demonstrate four nines purity in the material produced. The achievement is outstanding and is a fundamental validation that our flow sheet design and our long-term strategy to refine feedstock from our Cadoux project to produce high quality HPA is based on sound technical principles,” said FYI MD Roland Hill. “We see the results as being critical to the broader development of the flowsheet, particularly in light of several possible improvements that were noted during trial production, and we are eager to see how this develops with follow-up analysis of the optimised phase of production.”
