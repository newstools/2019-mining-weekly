TSX-listed Euro Sun Mining has announced the discovery of four new gold/copper porphyries directly adjacent to its Rovina Valley project, in Romania. The mineralisation on the Stanija prospecting permit could have synergies for its mine development on the Rovina licence, where the company is planning an initial project producing 1.67-million gold equivalent ounces over 12 years. The processing plant will process an estimated 20 000 t/d incorporating flotation and dry stack tailings deposition. Euro Sun has compiled historic surface exploration work completed on the Stanija project, which covers 42 km2, comprising state-geologic survey mapping, soil sampling and rock chip sampling.  In addition, Euro Sun has completed further soil sampling extension and infill grids, systematic litho-geochemistry sampling, and detailed geology-alteration mapping. Euro Sun reconnaissance rock chip sampling and grab sample assay results indicated the presence of porphyry-style gold/copper mineralisation and gold epithermal vein-style mineralisation. “Our team has worked diligently over the past three years on the Stanija prospecting licence to determine the discovery potential adjacent to our Rovina Valley project. Early field work included soil geochemistry, field mapping and selected grab samples and trenching. “We look forward to the initiation process by the National Agency for Mineral Resources of Romania for the exclusive exploration licence, which is expected to occur in early 2020,” said Euro Sun CEO Scott Moore.
