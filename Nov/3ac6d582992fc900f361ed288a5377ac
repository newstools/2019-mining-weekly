CONAKRY – South African miner AngloGold Ashanti suspended its gold mining operations in Guinea after a community protested on its Siguiri mining site, its Guinea subsidiary Societe Aurifère de Guinee (SAG) said in a statement. Protesters from the Fatoyah community invaded the site on Friday, erected barricades and disrupted production in order to demand the tarring of a road. SAG had to suspend its operations to safeguard its staff and property, the company said. "There is a tacit agreement between SAG and the villagers [...] to tar this road," resident Moussa Condé told Reuters by telephone. AngloGold Ashanti spokesperson Stewart Bailey said the company is in talks with community leaders to resolve the dispute. A 30 km tarred road linking the towns of Siguiri and Kintinian was recently completed, he said. The project was a partnership between the government and AngloGold Ashanti. The suspension puts a halt to all extraction and processing activities at the mine and pauses subcontracting services to SAG. Only a skeleton staff will remain on site, SAG said. AngloGold Ashanti owns 85% of SAG, whose Siguiri mine produced 242 000 oz of gold in 2018.
