Aim-listed Ariana Resources is gearing up for a 2 000 m drilling programme at its Salinbas gold project, where it was recently granted a ten-year renewal of its licence. The company has set up a reverse circulation drill rig to soon start the drilling programme, and MD Dr Kerim Sener says it should be complete by June. The Salinbas project comprises three notable licence areas: Salinbas, Ardala and Hizarliyayla, all of which are located within the multimillion-ounce Artvin goldfield. Ariana reports that it has secured its Ardala licence forestry permits for a drilling programme and site preparation, including road-building, which is under way. The forestry permits will enable drilling up to 10 000 m. Prior trial mining at the Ardala gold/copper/molybdenum porphyry provided a 10 000 t stockpile on site that has evidence of significant mineralisation – grades of 0.27 g/t gold, 0.14% copper and 72 g/t molybdenum. The “Hot Gold Corridor” contains several significant gold/copper projects including the four-million-ounce Hot Maden project, which lies 16 km to the south of Salinbas and 7 km south of Hizarliyayla.
