PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Mining major Rio Tinto has awarded a A$20-million, five-year contract with Yurra Pty Ltd to provide civil maintenance services around the company’s Pilbara rail network. Yurra is majority owned by the Yindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation (YAC), the appointed representative of the Yindjibarndi people, with the contract marking a landmark agreement for Rio. “We are delighted to have awarded Yurra its most significant contract to date and look forward to strengthening our relationship with the Yindjibarndi People, a highly valued and important partner for Rio Tinto in the Pilbara,” said Rio iron-ore MD for rail, port and core services Ivan Vella. “We are proud to have worked with Yurra since their inception over six years ago. Along the journey, they have demonstrated a strong ability to deliver a range of services. They bring a high level of capability in the contracted areas and do this on very competitive terms. “Yurra’s ability to maintain high levels of efficiency and low overheads despite their continued growth is a credit to their management and leadership team. “This contract is one of the first of its kind for Rio Tinto Iron Ore and one which we hope will prove a catalyst for many others like it in the future. We're committed to local jobs for local people and are excited about the opportunities this partnership provides,” said Vella. Additionally, Rio has awarded a near A$10-million contract to another majority-owned YAC business, with GSBC Yurra to refurbish the Rocklea Palms accommodation village in Paraburdoo. The work is expected to be completed later this year.
