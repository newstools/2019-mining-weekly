Canadian diamond miner Mountain Province on Monday announced that former Peregrine Diamonds CEO Tom Peregoodoff and former Lucara Diamond Corp CEO William Lamb would join its board of directors following the annual general meeting (AGM) next month. Investment professional Brett Desmond, who is also the son of Mountain Province’s major shareholder Dermot Desmond, would also join the company’s board. To accommodate the additions, Bruce Dresner, Carl Verley and Peeyush Varshney would step down from the board following the AGM. “These changes demonstrate the board's commitment to the long-term success of the company and the experience and expertise of the new board members in various aspects of our business will ensure that we continue to maximise the value of our quality assets,” commented chairperson Jonathan Comerford. Mountain Province’s primary asset is its 49% interest in the Gahcho Kué mine in the Northwest Territories with De Beers Canada.
