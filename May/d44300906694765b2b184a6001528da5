PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Ore processing at the Woodlawn zinc/copper mine, in New South Wales, has started, with the operation expected to progressively ramp up to an estimated throughput capacity of 1.5-million tonnes a year. ASX-listed Heron Resources on Wednesday told shareholders reclaimed tailings from hydraulic mining operations was being used in the new flotation treatment facility. “We are excited to have now achieved this significant milestone in the transition from explorer to producer with the processing of the first reclaimed tailings through the Woodlawn plant,” said Heron MD and CEO Wayne Taylor. “Commencing operations is timely, and we look forward to taking advantage of continuing favourable conditions in base metals markets as we ramp-up operations.” In addition to its focus on ramping up operations, Heron is also preparing for the first processing campaign of high-grade underground ore, which will proceed following the ramp-up programme. At steady state, Woodlawn is expected to produce 70 000 t/y of zinc concentrates, 30 000 t/y of copper concentrates and 25 000 t/y of lead concentrates.
