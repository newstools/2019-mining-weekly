Aim-listed AfriTin Mining on Monday announced that it had completed the first 20 diamond drill holes, which were recommended for the validation of the historical data by CSA Global, at its flagship Uis tin mine, in Namibia. The drill holes form part of the drilling programme designed to support the declaration of a mineral resource estimate on the V1 and V2 pegmatite. The drill holes have been geologically logged, sampled and are being analysed by a certified independent laboratory. AfriTin CEO Anthony Viljoen said the completion marks significant progress towards declaring a Joint Ore Reserves Committee-compliant mineral resource for the Uis project, which is a “major step for the company in order to confirm the historical data”. The down-dip, step-out drilling is in progress and an initial update of the geological model indicates a close correlation between the historic drill programme and the holes completed during the programme. The analytical results confirm that tin and tantalum mineralisation is primarily confined to pegmatite bodies. In areas where the V1 body has been separated into upper and lower units, the drill hole intercepted a xenolith of country rock that separates the pegmatite. While the results of the drilling remain subject to a resource modelling and validation process, Viljoen said the company “is encouraged by the initial results”.
