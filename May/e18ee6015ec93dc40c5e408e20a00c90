PERTH (miningweekly.com) – New data from the Chamber of Minerals and Energy of Western Australia (CME) has found that the state’s resources sector contributed more than A$57.7-billion to the Australian economy in 2017/18. In a survey of 41 Western Australian mining, oil and gas, energy and contractor companies, the CME found that the companies contributed some A$38-billion to the Western Australian economy alone, and a further A$19.7-billion to the greater Australian economy. “The data provided by 41 resources sector operations for the financial year 2017/18, shows how industry’s spending flows through to every part of Western Australia, by means of wages and salaries, business purchases, government payments and community contributions,” CME CEO Paul Everingham said. “And this survey is just a snapshot of the sector’s contribution to the broader economy, the actual figure is likely to be substantially higher than A$57.7-billion.” The sector financially supported 772 community organisations in the state, and a further 15 nationally, and purchased goods and services from 13 654 Western Australia businesses and 6 583 businesses located elsewhere in Australia. The Western Australian resources sector spent some A$7.78-billion on wages and salaries in 2017/18, of which A$7.4-billion was spent in Western Australia, with the sector making A$14.8-billion in state and federal government payments, of which A$5.2-billion was paid in Western Australia alone.
