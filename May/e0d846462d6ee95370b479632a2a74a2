PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Iron-ore miner Hancock Prospecting has increased its cash offer for unlisted Canadian coal company Riversdale Resources from A$2.20 a share to A$2.70 a share. Hancock, which currently holds a 40.43% stake in Riversdale, said this week that the increased offer was conditional upon the company achieving an interest of more than 85% in Riversdale on a fully diluted basis at the close of the offer on May 10. Riversdale has maintained its advice that shareholders should reject the offer. An independent expert had previously determined a fair market value of between A$2.56 and A$3.05 a share for Riversdale shares. Riversdale’s main holding is the Grassy Mountain hard coking coal project, which is expected to produce some 93-million tonnes of coal over its proposed 24-year mine life, with first production flagged for 2021. The project is estimated to host a measured and indicated resource of about 195-million tonnes.
