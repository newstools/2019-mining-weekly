Project developer Aquila Resources on Monday announced that the state of Michigan had issued a final decision and order upholding the mining permit for its Back Forty zinc and gold project. The Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin and an individual owing property near the project site in 2017 challenged the mining permit, but following hearings and testimony, a judge on May 3 ruled that the proposed mining operation would operate in compliance with the state’s non-ferrous metallic mining statute. “Aquila will continue its efforts with the state of Michigan and local communities to demonstrate our commitment to environmental responsibility and sustainable resource development that benefits all stakeholders. The Back Forty mine will be a safe, disciplined operation that promotes and supports local community socioeconomic development and is protective of the environment,” said president and CEO Barry Hildred. Back Forty is an openpit volcanogenic massive sulphide deposit with underground potential located along the mineral‐rich Penokean Volcanic Belt in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. The project contains about 1.1-billion pounds of zinc and one-million ounces of gold. According to a 2018 feasibility study, the project has a life of seven years with total payable gold production of 468 000 oz, at an average of 67 000 oz/y. The total payable zinc production is about 512-million pounds, at an average of 73-million pounds a year. Initial project capital costs were estimated at $294-million with a 24-month construction period, and sustaining capital costs were valued at about $110.6-million. Aquila, which trades on the TSX, has received all state and federal permissions required for the construction and start of operations at Back Forty.
