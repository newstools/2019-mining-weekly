PERTH (miningweekly.com) - Diamond miner Lucapa Diamond Company has reported sales revenue of A$5-million for the sale of a parcel of 7 008 ct of rough diamonds from its Mothae operation, in Lesotho. The ASX-listed company noted that the tender, in Antwerp, included prices of up to $26 000/ct for individual gems. MD Stephen Wetherall said on Wednesday that the latest tender results continued to underline Mothae’s status as one of a select few global mines capable of producing high value diamonds on a consistent basis. “We continue to be encouraged by the regular recovery of specials and sales results achieved from the supposed lower-margin areas of the Mothae kimberlite pipe. “These results add to the excitement as our mining campaign prepares to transition to the higher-margin diamond zones in the main southern pit in the second half of the year, once the water is transferred to our main dam to ensure we have appropriate water supplies for our planned increased treatment rates during the dry months.” Lucapa is currently considering a third tender for the first half of the year, following the continued strong recoveries from the new 1.1-million-tonne-a-year plant.
