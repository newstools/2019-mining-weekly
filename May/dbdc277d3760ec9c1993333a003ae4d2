The team behind Kaminak Gold – the company that discovered the multimillion-ounce Coffee gold project and sold it to Goldcorp for C$520-million in 2016 – has regrouped and formed a new minerals exploration company. Tectonic Metals was founded nearly two years ago by Eira Thomas, Tony Reda and Rob Carpenter. These executives have joined forces with Alaska-based mineral exploration consulting firm Avalon Development president Curt Freeman. The exploration junior has announced that it is seeking to raise C$5-million through a special warrant financing and that it is pursuing a direct listing on the TSX-V. The funds from the offering will contribute to advancing four gold projects, where up to three projects will be drill tested this year. "It was clear from day one that Eira, Rob, Curt and I shared a passion for mineral exploration and discovery and the desire to bring something different to the mineral industry.  Tectonic was the answer.  Behind every successful company is a great team, and I am blessed to be working with such esteemed professionals dedicated and committed to working for our shareholders and making Tectonic a success.  Now that we had a taste of what it takes to discover and advance a multimillion-ounce gold district, we are hungrier than ever to not only do it again, but to do it better on every front imaginable.  At Tectonic, our vision is simple – to be the number one mineral exploration company in the world.  Now is the time for us to share that vision, passion and enthusiasm with the world on a larger stage," commented Reda, who is Tectonic’s president and CEO.
