The underground mining rate of the Island Gold mine, in Ontario, is to increase to 1 200 t/d next year, Canadian intermediate miner Alamos Gold reported on Tuesday. The Phase 2 expansion has gained approval from the Ontario Environment, Conservation and Parks Ministry. The mine was previously permitted to operate at 1 100 t/d. With a mine and mill that can support throughput rates of 1 200 t/d, no additional capital will be required for the Phase 2 expansion. In parallel, the company is continuing with a large ongoing exploration programme at Island Gold, which has been successful in driving significant growth in mineral reserves and resources the last several years. The ongoing exploration success is being incorporated into a Phase 3 expansion study beyond 1 200 t/d. Besides Island Gold, Alamos also operates the Young-Davidson mine, in Ontario, as well as the Mulatos and El Chanate mines in Sonora state, Mexico.
