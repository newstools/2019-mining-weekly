The date by which Canadian miner Centerra Gold and the government of Kyrgyzstan had planned to satisfy conditions relating to a 2017 strategic agreement has been extended yet again – this time to the end of July. The first ‘longstop date’ under the strategic agreement for environmental protection and investment promotion was initially slated for May 31, 2018. But it has been extended several times, with the most recent extension from May 31, 2019, to July 31, 2019. Despite the delays, the Toronto-listed miner said on Tuesday that it would continue to work with the government to satisfy the remaining conditions precedent and to complete the strategic agreement “as soon as possible”. The agreement between the parties ended a long-standing legal battle over the Kumtor mine.
