KOLKATA (miningweekly.com) – Rising consumption and falling domestic production has increased India’s crude oil import dependency to 83.7% during 2018/19, compared with 82.9% during previous financial year, data from Petroleum and Natural Gas Ministry has showed. Despite Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ostensible target to cut India’s crude oil import dependency to 67% by 2022,  in reality it has been on an upward curve from 80.6% in 2015/16 to 81.7% in 2016/17 and 82.19% in 2017/18, government released data indicates. The rising import dependency is in direct correlation to domestic crude oil consumption rising from 184.7-million s in 2015/16 to 194.6-million tons in 2016/17 and further to 206.2-million ton in 2017/18. During 2018/19, total domestic consumption was up 2.6% at 211.6-million tons. This has been matched by falling domestic crude oil production over the past years, according to the Ministry data. India’s crude oil production was recorded at 36.9-million tons in 2015/16, failing to 36-million tons in 2016/17 and negative growth persisted with further fall to 35.7-million tons in 2017/18 and 34.2-million tons in 2018/19. In absolute monetary terms, Indian crude oil import bill was estimated at $111.9-billion, up from $87.8-billion in the previous financial year. In the current year, the Ministry has projected crude oil imports to rise to 233-million tons, entailing an estimated bill of $112.7-billion. However, it is believed that the estimated crude oil import volumes and bill for the current year had not factored in the impact of US Administration ending sanction waiver for Indian crude oil imports from Iran, the third largest sources of Indian crude oil inward shipments. A section of analysts observed that the marginal 0.7% increase in crude oil import bill forecast for the current year seemed “extremely conservative” considering that persistent downward bias of the Indian rupee exchange rate against the dollar. At the same time, with the US Administration vowing to bring Iranian crude oil supplies to global markets to nil and Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries steadfast in not increasing production, import costs of crude oil in dollar terms was bound to strengthen in the current year. Imports costs would also get an upward push even as Indian attempted to replace Iranian crude oil supplies with imports from newer sources like Brazil and Mexico entailing higher freight charges and shorter credit terms compared to offers from Iran till now, the analysts added.
