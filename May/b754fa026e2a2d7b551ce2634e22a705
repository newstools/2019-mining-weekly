JSE-listed mining group Wescoal on Tuesday announced the appointment of Enos Lentsoane as the company’s new executive head of commercial and investments, effective from May 1. Lentsoane will be responsible for identifying potential acquisitions, partnerships and investments that align with strategic growth initiatives of the company. Lentsoane has over 12 years of investment banking experience, with the latter six years focusing on mining advisory at Nedbank’s corporate and investment banking division, and Cinga Capital. Further, Zanele Sibisi was appointed mining COO, effective from May 1. Sibisi will be responsible for the management of Wescoal’s Elandspruit, Vanggatfontein and Khanyisa operations to drive operational stability and efficiency. The company added that she may also be responsible for more mining operations in the future, as other projects – such as the Arnot mine and Moabsvelden – are transitioned from project development into operations. Sibisi joins the Wescoal team with over 18 years of coal mining experience, in both underground and opencast operations, with the last ten years of her career having been at South32.
