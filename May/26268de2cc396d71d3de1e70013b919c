London-listed Petra Diamonds has sold the 424.89 ct Legacy of the Cullinan Diamond Mine diamond to Stargems Group/Choron for just under $15-million. The exceptional D-colour Type IIa diamond was mined from the Cullinan C-Cut and adds to the most famous diamonds to have originated from the historic mine. "This is a significant sale for Petra and an endorsement of the quality not only of the Legacy diamond, but also the Cullinan orebody itself, which is known for its exceptional stones," Petra CEO Richard Duffy said on Tuesday. Stargems Group chairperson Shailesh Javeri said it was an honour for the company to have the opportunity to polish the Legacy of the Cullinan Diamond Mine.
