The Competition Appeal Court on Friday gave the green light to Sibanye-Stillwater's takeover of Lonmin in a deal that aims to create the world's second-largest platinum producer. Lonmin's biggest mining union, the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union, filed an appeal to try to block the deal, which was earlier approved by South Africa's competition watchdog.
