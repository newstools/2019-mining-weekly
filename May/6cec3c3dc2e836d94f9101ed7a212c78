PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Diversified miner South32 has awarded an asset services contract to ASX-listed SRG Global for its Worsley alumina operation, in Western Australia, that could be worth some A$60-million. The contract will be for an initial three years, but could be extended for a further three years. If the contract extension option is exercised, it could generate revenues of some A$60-million for SRG, and around A$32-million over the initial three-year term.

Work on the contract will start in June this year and will increase SRG’s workforce by some 100 positions.
