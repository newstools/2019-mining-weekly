PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Junior Aus Tin Mining is planning to start initial mining at its Taronga Stage 1 operation, in New South Wales, before the end of June, after receiving approval of its mining operations plan from the state’s Department of Planning and Environment. The A$3-million Stage 1 project will trial mine some 340 000 t of ore in an 18-month to 24-month period, to produce a tin concentrate. “Final approval for the Taronga Stage 1 represents a major milestone for the company. An enormous amount of work has historically been completed at the Taronga project by groups such as BHP and Newmont, but Aus Tin Mining’s exciting programme, including large-scale trial mining and pilot processing, will aim to demonstrate the proof of concept that will enable the development of a large-scale tin mining operation within one of Australia’s more productive tin fields,” said Aus Tin chairperson Brian Moller. The initial Stage 1 operation will likely be funded through the recently completed private placement and share purchase plan, and the majority of the capital spend is likely to take place in the second half of 2019 to coincide with the expected sustained cashflows from the Granville tin project. Aus Tin is also progressing discussions with possible concentrate offtake parties, and is exploring the opportunity for associated project funding, the company said on Monday.
