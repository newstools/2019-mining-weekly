Development company Noront Resources has settled on a site for the ferrochrome plant that it plans to build to treat ore from its chromite mines in the emerging Ring of Fire camp, but the junior is expecting “lengthy” environmental assessment phase and says commissioning of the facility is still nearly a decade away. Noront has dropped Kidd Metsite in Timmins, Ontario, and instead selected the Algoma Steel site in Sault Ste Marie – a city on the St Mary’s river, in Ontario, for its ferrochrome plant. Four sites initially participated in the bidding, but Sudbury and Thunder Bay dropped in July last year. Noront explained last week that the two sites were similar on a discounted net present value basis, but on a cash flow basis, when a potential 100-year life for the project was accounted for, the analysis favoured Sault Ste Marie. Based on its preliminary activity schedule, ferrochrome feasibility study would be completed in late 2024, and project construction would be initiated in the following year. The project is expected to be commissioned in the second quarter of 2028. Noront stated that it anticipated a lengthy and comprehensive environmental permitting process, which would allow the company to engage in a fulsome way with the citizens of Sault Ste. Marie and other stakeholders, including environmental groups and First Nations. The next step will be to finalize the development plan and timelines for an all-season road to the Ring of Fire with the provincial government and their community partners. Noront is focused on the development of its high-grade Eagle’s Nest nickel, copper, platinum and palladium deposit and the chromite deposits including Blackbird, Black Thor, and Big Daddy, all of which are located in the James Bay Lowlands of Ontario.
