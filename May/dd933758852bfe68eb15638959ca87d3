New shallow, high-grade intersections received from a further 24 holes of the 66-hole reverse circulation infill drilling programme at ASX-listed Pensana Metals’ Longonjo neodymium and praseodymium (NdPr) project, in Angola, have returned some of the highest-grade NdPr mineralisation ever encountered at the project, the company said in a statement on Tuesday. The latest results confirm the continuity of the thick blanket of NdPr mineralisation from surface as the company advances the project towards development. “These high-grade NdPr intersections are exceptional and demonstrate that the weathered blanket of mineralisation at Longonjo contains some of the best global NdPr grades. “The close spaced drilling in the proposed openpit area is confirming the continuity of the NdPr mineralisation over substantial widths from surface and will provide the detail required to support an upgrade of this part of the mineral resource estimate from the current inferred to the indicated category, as is required for a preliminary feasibility study,” commented Pensana executive director Dave Hammond.
