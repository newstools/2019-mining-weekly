PERTH (miningweekly.com) â€“ The shareholders of ASX-listed Maximus Resources have overwhelmingly voted in favour of maintaining the current board, following a failed spill attempt by shareholder Kesli Chemicals. Maximus on Friday noted that a near record 32% of all issued shares were voted by proxy ahead of the shareholder meeting, with 91.5% of all voting cast against the board spill. Kesli, which holds 6.66% in Maximus, in March issued the company with a notice, calling for the replacement of the three existing Maximus directors with three Kesli nominees. Only 7.4% of the votes cast at the shareholder meeting on Friday were in favour of the Kesli proposal.
