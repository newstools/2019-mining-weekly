The 28-member streamlined Cabinet unveiled by President Cyril Ramaphosa on Wednesday night includes a new-look economic cluster, which consolidates the departments of trade and industry and economic development, as well as the departments of mineral resources and energy. As was widely anticipated, Ramaphosa reappointed Tito Mboweni as Finance Minister and retained Pravin Gordhan as Public Enterprises Minister. Dr David Masondo was appointed as Deputy Minister of Finance. The President also confirmed that David Mabuza would be Deputy President. Former Economic Development Minister Ebrahim Patel was named Trade and Industry Minister, while Gwede Mantashe was appointed Minister of Mineral Resources and Energy. Former Energy Minister Jeff Radebe, who has served in every Cabinet since the one assembled by President Nelson Mandela in 1994, was not included in the executive team. The new Cabinet has been downsized from 36 members and has a 50/50 gender balance, but excludes controversial African National Congress (ANC) Women's League president Bathabile Dlamini. The most surprising appointment, however, was that of Good Party leader Patricia de Lille, who was named Minister of Public Works and Infrastructure. The other members of the executive named by Ramaphosa at the briefing, which took place at the Unions Buildings, in Pretoria were: Ramaphosa stressed that the new Cabinet had been appointed against a backdrop of "great economic difficulties" and amid constraints on public finances. "It is therefore imperative that in all areas and spheres of government, we place priority on revitalising our economy while exercising the greatest care in the use of public funds," the President said at the briefing that was delayed, owing to protracted consultations within the ANC and the broader governing alliance.
