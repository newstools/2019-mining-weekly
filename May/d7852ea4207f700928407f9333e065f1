Intermediate gold miner New Gold has restarted milling operations at its Rainy River operation after a temporary shutdown to tackle excess water in the tailings management area (TMA). The mill was shut down on April 24 and was rest started late in the afternoon on Friday. New Gold reported on Monday that the water level in the TMA had been lowered to a desirable operational level and pumping into the water management pond continued. Mining and crushing operations continued during the temporary shutdown period and the mine’s production guidance remained unaffected. Rainy River is forecast to produce between 250 000 oz and 275 000 gold-equivalent ounces (GEO) this year. In the first quarter, the mine delivered 62 278 GEO – a significant improvement on the year-earlier performance of 40 016 GEO. New Gold also owns the New Afton mine, in Canada, and the Cerro San Pedro mine in Mexico, as well as the Blackwater project in Canada.
