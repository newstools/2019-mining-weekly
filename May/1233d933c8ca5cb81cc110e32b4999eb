The Dundee ilmenite project that Bluejay Mining is advancing will bring significant employment opportunities and economic development to the region and Greenland in general, the Aim- and FSE-listed company reported on Friday. Announcing the completion and submission of the social impact assessment (SIA) to the government of Greenland, Bluejay said that the study indicated that Dundee would create a new sustainable workplace in an area of Greenland that currently had few job opportunities. The mine would create up to 175 direct employment positions and a number of indirect jobs once fully operational. The mine would also serve to increase skills and would elevate the training among the workforce within the nascent mining industry of Greenland. Bluejay would cooperate with national education institutions, such as the Greenland School of Minerals and Petroleum. The SIA forms a critical cornerstone in the application for an exploitation permit. The submitted study was completed based on the development scenario of 440 000 t/y of ilmenite product to be shipped from the project. â€œThe simplicity of the mining and processing mean it can be easily implemented, is well-matched for the available Greenlandic workforce made up of local communities, and is well-suited for elevating the level of qualifications in the mining sector in Greenland. Importantly, the public pre-hearings and stakeholder interviews carried out as part of the SIA have shown very positive support towards the project," commented Camilla Christensen from engineering consultancy company NIRAS Gruppen, which prepared the SIA. With the environmental impact assessment and SIA now submitted, the last remaining components of the permitting process for Dundas are the mineral reserve, mine plan and impact benefit agreement.
