PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Gold junior Focus Minerals has reported a 25% increase in the mineral resource at its Karridale deposit, which forms part of the Laverton gold project, in Western Australia. The deposit is now estimated to contain some 15.7-million tonnes of resource at 1.3 g/t gold, for 672 000 oz contained ounces, with 154 000 oz of this classified as indicated and 518 000 oz as inferred. “This is a very pleasing outcome for Focus and based on the success of the successful rounds of drilling that we carried out at Karridale. So far, only 40% of the Karridale footprint has been drill-tested, with mineralisation open along strike and depth to highlight the resource growth potential,” said Focus CEO Zhaoya Wang. “As we continue drilling across our broader Laverton gold project area, our confidence is rising that we have the potential to define a regionally significant gold project in the north-eastern goldfields.” Based on the current understanding of the Karridale deposit, Focus has projected an initial exploration target of between 1-million and 1.4-million ounces to a depth of up to 200 m. The exploration target will be assessed by exploration drilling over the next 24 months.
