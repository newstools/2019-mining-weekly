PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Rare earths producer Northern Minerals is set to benefit from a A$51-million capital allocation by the Western Australian government to upgrade roads in the East Kimberley region. The miner on Monday said that the upgrades of the Duncan road and Gordon Downs road in the East Kimberley would provide greater access to its Browns Range project. Northern Minerals’ operational plan for the Browns Range project had previously anticipated that the project would be inaccessible by road, and unable to operate, for up to 60 days each year during the wet season. With the improved access to be delivered by the upgrades of both the Duncan and Gordon Down roads, there was potential to expand annual production rates at the pilot plant project, and provide additional supply of rare earth carbonate. “We are very pleased that the government recognises the potential of the East Kimberley region and has taken the decision to not only invest in the road infrastructure servicing the remote communities near Browns Range, but fund a broader plan to create local jobs and support the region’s economy through greater service delivery,” said MD George Bauk. Northern Minerals in December of last year shipped its first heavy rare earth carbonate from the Browns Range pilot project, in Western Australia, after construction of the plant reached practical completion in October. The pilot plant is expected to produce 573 000 kg of mixed heavy rare earth carbonate containing terbium and dysprosium as revenue products, over a three-year period.
