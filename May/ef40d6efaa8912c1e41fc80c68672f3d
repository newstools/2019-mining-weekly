PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Junior iron-ore developer Fenix Resources has struck a joint cooperation agreement with the manager at the Port of Geraldton, in Western Australia, providing export options for its Iron Ridge project. The joint cooperation agreement would see Fenix and the Mid West Ports Authority (MWPA) investigate how MWPA could provide some one-million tonnes a year of export capacity through the port. “The execution of this joint cooperation agreement represents yet another advancement in a key component of our future operations as we strive towards the development of the Iron Ridge project,” said Fenix MD Robert Brierley. “With the recent trucking joint venture signed and excellent preliminary metallurgical results, the agreement is another step towards the completion of our logistics chain.” A feasibility study on Iron Ridge is due in December this year, based on a resource estimate of 9.2-million tonnes grading 64.1% iron.
