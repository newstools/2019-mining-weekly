ASX-listed Pensana Metals has appointed RFC Ambrian as its broker and agent ahead of its planned listing on the LSE later this year. Ambrian’s role will be to provide ongoing support and guidance to the company regarding marketing of the company’s shares in the UK and Europe. Pensana is developing the Longonjo neodymium and praseodymium project, in Angola, for which a prefeasibility study is expected to be completed in September. The study will also include an updated mineral resource estimate. Anglo American veteran Tim George was recently appointed CEO to lead the development of the Longonjo project.
