PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Gold miner Perseus Mining has appointed Daniel Lougher as a nonexecutive director, bringing the total number of Perseus’ board to six. In addition to his role as nonexecutive director, Lougher will also serve as chairperson of the technical committee. Lougher is currently MD and CEO of nickel miner Western Areas, and has held the role since 2012. His career spans more than 35 years and he has held corporate roles in Australian and international mining companies, and has spent time in Africa with BHP Billiton, Impala Platinum, Anglo American and Genmin. “Lougher has a huge amount of relevant work experience gained over many years in the international mining business and with first class professional qualifications to match, his skills set and his knowledge perfectly complement those of the other members of our board,” said Perseus chairperson Sean Harvey. Perseus earlier this week started the development of its $265-million Yaouré gold mine, in Côte d’Ivoire. The mine is slated to produce an average of 215 000 oz/y over the first five years of its mine life, with first gold targeted in December 2020.
