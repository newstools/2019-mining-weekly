Aim-listed Armadale Capital on Wednesday provided an update regarding its plans to commercialise the Mahenge Liandu graphite project, ahead of anticipated completion of a definitive feasibility study in the fourth quarter. The company confirmed that key meetings with current and prospective Chinese offtake and project finance partners are scheduled for early June.

A graphite resource update for the Mahenge project will be published by the end of June.
