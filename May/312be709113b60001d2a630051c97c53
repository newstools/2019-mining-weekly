Field operations at Aim-listed African Battery Metals’ (ABM’s) Kisinka copper/cobalt project, in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), have now been completed. ABM executive director Paul Johnson says the team “coped well with difficult on-site logistics as grass levels remained high after late rains, and we recruited additional casual support staff to ensure the timely completion of the field phase of activities”. The initial programme has been carried out with speed and efficiency, he says, which bodes well for the company’s ability to operate effectively in the DRC. Recent highlights at the project include the deployment of two field geologists, five field technicians, two logistical support staff and 14 casual labourers at the project. A total of 663 termite mound samples, excluding samples collected for quality assurance and control purposes, were collected over three weeks on a grid covering the whole licence area, and field activities were concluded on May 11. Sample preparation is now being carried out and is scheduled to be completed shortly. Thereafter, X-ray fluorescence spectrometry analysis will be carried out to identify anomalous levels of copper and cobalt.
