PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The Vista gold plant, in southern Peru, has been granted its final operator’s permit by the Regional Energy and Mines Department, owner Titan Minerals reported. The permit allows for the construction and operation of a mineral facility with up to 350 t/d of processing capacity, as well as a tailings pond. “We are extremely pleased with the achievement of this important milestone and consider that the receipt of the final operator’s permit from the Peruvian authorities is testament to the quality and professionalism of our Peruvian operational and management team and is validation of Titan’s social licence to operate in Peru,” said Titan executive chairperson Matthew Carr. The gold plant will have a 150 t/d nameplate capacity and can generate up to 90 oz/d of gold, based on monthly average grades of between 17 g/t to 20 g/t gold, as achieved in 2018. The plant will initially run at a rate of 80 t/d at the start of commercial production, and will reach 120 t/d within six months. The plant has been designed to increase its capacity to 350 t/d with minimal capital outlay.
