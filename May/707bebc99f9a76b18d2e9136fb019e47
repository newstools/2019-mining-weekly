PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Lithium miner Galaxy Resources on Thursday confirmed discussions over possible cooperation in a chemical processing plant in China. The confirmation comes following reports that the debt-free Galaxy was looking to invest in a chemicals processing plant in the region. Galaxy told shareholders that all conversations, at present, have been informal and were incomplete, and that no binding or non-binding documentation have been signed. However, it noted that should an ‘appropriate opportunity’ arise that was worthy of further investigation, the company could enter into one or more non-binding arrangements. Galaxy recently reported record monthly production at its Mt Cattlin lithium operation, in Western Australia, producing 21 910 t of lithium concentrate in the month of April.
