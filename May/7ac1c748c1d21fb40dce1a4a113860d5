PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Senex Energy has started commissioning of the Roma North natural gas processing facility, in the western Surat basin, after achieving mechanical completion. The completed facility comprises four gas compressors providing some 6 PJ/y of initial gas processing capacity, which can be expanded to 9 PJ/y at low cost, with modular design allowing for a further doubling of capacity to around 18 PJ/y. The facility also includes a dehydration unit to remove water from the gas, and a 5.6 km pipeline connecting to the Comet Ridge to Wallumbilla pipeline. Senex MD and CEO Ian Davies on Monday said that Roma North was an important infrastructure piece for the company’s long-term growth and for the east coast gas market. “Senex is the first independent Queensland natural gas company in recent years to start commissioning a greenfield processing facility. This outcome is testament to Senex’s considerable operational capabilities, which are setting us up for further growth as we begin the next phase of drilling this month and plan future appraisal activity.” Senex is expected to start processed gas sales to the Gladstone liquefied natural gas project by the middle of this year.
