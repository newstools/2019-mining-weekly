BENGALURU â€“ Acacia Mining said on Friday its North Mara gold mine would be issued an environmental protection order (EPO) relating to alleged historical breaches of environmental regulations in Tanzania. Acacia, majority-owned by Barrick Gold, is embroiled in a long-running tax dispute with Tanzania and had cut output by a third after the government banned the export of mineral concentrates in 2017. The company said the Tanzanian government was considering issuing an EPO because of alleged deficiencies at its tailings storage facility, adding that operations at the mine would not be affected.
