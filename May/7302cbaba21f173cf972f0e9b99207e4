Diversified miner Bauba Platinum has entered into a trial product sale agreement with Northam subsidiary Booysendal Platinum. The agreement is effective from April this year and will see Northam process 24 000 t of low-grade chrome ore to be supplied by Bauba at its concentrator plant over a six-month period. Earnings and expenses flowing from the sale of the product will be shared between the parties in accordance with the agreement terms. “This is a significant milestone in Bauba’s product offering following the commissioning of its wash plant, adding an additional revenue stream from [Bauba’s] Moeijelijk mine,” Bauba CEO Nick van der Hoven said on Monday.
