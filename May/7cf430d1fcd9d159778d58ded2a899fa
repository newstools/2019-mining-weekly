MOSCOW â€“ Russia's largest gold producer Polyus said on Tuesday it plans to materially accelerate capital expenditure in the second and third quarters of the year, without exceeding the $725-million it expects to spend in the year as a whole. "We still expect to spend $725-million across all or business units in 2019," CEO Pavel Grachev said on a call with investors on Tuesday.
