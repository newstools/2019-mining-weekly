PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Centrex Metals has inked a second offtake agreement for phosphate rock concentrate from its Ardmore project, in Queensland. Centrex has reached an agreement with New Zealand fertilizer group Ballance Agri-Nutrients to supply some 5 000 t of concentrate, which will be produced as part of the trial production process anticipated to start in 2019. The concentrate shipment will be produced by the 70 t/h modular wet processing plant that is currently in transit to Ardmore, and which can be upgradable to 140 t/h for the proposed full-scale operation to produce some 800 000 t/y of concentrate. Centrex CEO Simon Slesarewich said the contract with Ballance validated the quality of Ardmore’s product and its attractiveness to target customers. Centrex is progressing all other activities to advance the project, including concentrate sales and contracting. The company noted that discussions were ongoing with a select number of other potential long-term offtake customers regarding offtake during the trial mining.
