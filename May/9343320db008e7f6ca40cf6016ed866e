A court case against the directors of Aurora Empowerment Systems has been postponed to July 15 to allow the State to locate one of the accused, the Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa) said on Tuesday. Aurora directors Khulubuse Zuma, Zondwa Mandela and Thulani Ngubane appeared in the Springs regional magistrate’s court on Tuesday, but the State needed to locate Raja Zainal Alam Shah. Aurora had been in charge of the Grootvlei gold mine, near Springs, between 2009 and 2011 and is alleged to have allowed the looting of mine assets, which not only resulted in jobs being lost, but also the alleged uncontrolled pollution of water sources by acid mine drainage. Among others, the directors have been charged with the unlawful use of water, failing to comply with the conditions attached to the water-use licence issued by the Department of Water and Sanitation, as well as failing to comply with a compliance notice. “While we expected the postponement, we are eager to see the accused successfully prosecuted for their hand in destroying the environment and the community that depends on it,” said Outa water and environment portfolio manager Yamkela Ntola.
