The expansion of the Proyecto Riotinto mine to 15-million tonnes a year has achieved full mechanical completion and the expanded plant should reach its nameplate capacity in December, dual-listed Atalaya Mining announced on Monday. The expansion should result in the Spain-based copper operation increasing its production to between 50 000 t/y and 55 000 t/y in 2020, compared with the guided 45 000 t for this year. Atalaya reported that the new semi-autogenous mill, new primary crusher and all associated equipment had been running continuously and were ready to start receiving ore and ramping up to production during wet commissioning. The additional electricity supply for the expansion is expected to come on stream during the current quarter. "This expansion is a milestone for Atalaya. It will increase copper production, improve operational efficiencies, reduce maintenance requirements and lower operating cash costs for the company,” said CEO Alberto Lavandeira. The capital cost of the project has been estimated at €80.4-million.
