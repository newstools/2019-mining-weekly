Exploration and development company Kore Potash has appointed Andrey Maruta as CFO, effective from September 23. He will succeed John Crews, who is stepping down for personal reasons. Crews will remain available to Kore until November to ensure a smooth transition. Maruta is a chartered and certified accountant, with more than 16 years' experience in the mining industry, including as CFO of Petropavlovsk. He has also worked in the audit function at accountancy firm Moore Stephens International in both the UK and the Russian Federation. Maruta will report directly to the CEO and will not join the company's board. "The company is in a strong position to realise its potential in developing the world-class Sintoukola potash basin and Andrey's experience in the sector will prove of great benefit to Kore as we move through the next stages of growth towards financing and production," Kore CEO Brad Sampson said on Friday. Aim-, ASX- and JSE-listed Kore's primary asset is its 97%-owned Sintoukola potash project in Congo-Brazzaville. "I would also like to thank John Crews for his contribution to the company over the past two years," said Sampson.
