Terry Robinson, a board member of Glencoreâ€™s Africa unit and a number of other mining companies, has died, following a brief illness. A qualified accountant, Robinson served on the board of TSX-listed Katanga Mining since January 2008. He was also a long-standing member of the board of gold miner Highland Gold, which he joined in July 2008. His other directorships included a nonexecutive position at steel and mining firm Evraz and a nonexecutive position at Russian coal miner Raspadskaya. "On behalf of the board and everyone at Highland Gold, I would like to offer our deepest, sincerest condolences to Terry's wife and family. Terry was a true gentleman in every sense of the word, and his experience, judgment, incomparable attention to detail and, most of all, his friendship will be sorely missed," said Highland executive chairperson Eugene Shvidler. Robinson passed away on Friday.
