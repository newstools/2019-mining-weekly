The electrification of London-listed Premier African Minerals’ 49%-owned RHA tungsten mine, in Zimbabwe, is expected to be concluded by the end of November. The miner on Monday noted that it had received confirmation of this from the Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (Zesa). Premier CEO George Roach added that work to bringing the underground operations at RHA back on stream could now start. The works at RHA will be divided into two phases that will be commissioned concurrently in an attempt to reduce the completion time. Phase 1 will include the supply of materials and the installation and commissioning of infrastructure and includes a 400 V changeover panel and LV power cabling to existing 400 V feeder panel. Phase 2 will comprise the supply of materials, as well as the installation and commissioning of the proposed 400 m 33 kV overhead line T-off and a 500 kVA 33/0.4 kV pad-mounted soft start up to high-voltage of the transformer. Premier’s share price rose by 36% to 0.04p shortly after the announcement was made on Monday afternoon.
