JSE- and TSX-V-listed Alphamin Resources has appointed Maritz Smith as its new CEO, with Boris Kamstra stepping down from the position with immediate effect. Kamstra will, however, continue to serve as an executive director of Alphamin with responsibilities that include investor relations, tin marketing and special value-add projects.

Maritz has 18 years of experience in all aspects of directing mining operations and is, according to the miner, “well suited” to guide Alphamin through its next phase of operations and corporate objectives. Alphamin chairperson Charles Needham on Tuesday said this planned change in leadership personnel at Alphamin came at a time when the Bisie mine, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, was starting to take its place as a significant and responsible producer of tin to the world. Additionally, the miner reported that the plant commissioning at its flagship mine was progressing along a positive trend line and that production metrics had improved over the last three months.
