Aim-listed Cora Gold has received assay results from three out of four core holes completed at the Sanankoro gold discovery, in southern Mali, in the third quarter of this year. This has confirmed vertical continuity of gold mineralisation at the Selin prospect to depths of 170 m. The core drill programme at Selin and Zone A was aimed at providing information on the potential for gold sulphide mineralisation at depths previously untested by the company. Intersections reported include 13 m at 1.84 g/t gold; and 17.5 m at 2.70 g/t gold. The results demonstrated the potential to significantly expand the scale of discovery at Sanankoro, Cora said in a statement issued on Monday. “We continue to improve our understanding of the potential of Sanankoro and the results from these first three core drill holes have provided strong encouragement for the continuity of gold sulphide mineralisation at considerable depth,” said CEO Jonathan Forster. He indicated that the company’s geological understanding of the style of gold mineralisation at both prospects was expanding, with evidence emerging for late-stage disruption of gold mineralisation by shearing. “These core holes were drilled at the end of what has been a highly successful and transformative drill programme for the company. “The findings, to date, have not only improved our understanding of the gold mineralisation at Sanankoro but have also demonstrated continuity of the gold mineralisation over 2.2 km of the Selin structure, with potential for extension at depth.” The company expects to report the final set of drill results and an initial mineral resource estimate, as well as deliver a scoping study on the project, before the end of this year.
