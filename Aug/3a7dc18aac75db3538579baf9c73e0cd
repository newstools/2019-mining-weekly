Armenia Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan on Monday said that Canadian miner Lydian International would be permitted to proceed with the contested Amulsar project. “The information we currently is very clear, the exploitation of the mine does not harm the environment,” the Prime Minister reportedly said in a live session broadcast on social media platform Facebook. Environmental groups and some locals have campaigned against the mining project over concerns that it would pollute the Jermuk springs. But the project has now been subject to three full-scale environmental audits in the last 12 months and passed the most recent audit last week. Work on the Amuslar project was halted in June last year, when protestors set up illegal blockades preventing access to the mine. Police has failed to act on complaints from the company to remove the protestors and was forced by a court ruling on Friday to launch criminal investigations into the actions of the protestors. The protestors are reportedly mostly ecologists and local residents. Lydian interim president and CEO Edward Sellers said in a statement on Monday that there were still significant challenges ahead for the miner to recover and rebuilt its capacity in Armenia. The company has dismissed the majority of its workforce in the wake of the illegal blockades. Amulsar will be a large-scale operation with production targeted to average about 225 000 oz/y over an initial ten-year mine life.
