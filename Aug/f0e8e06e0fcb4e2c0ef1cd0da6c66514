PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Western Australia’s Environment Minister Stephen Dawson has granted ASX-listed Hastings Technology Metals environmental approval for its Yangibana rare earths project. The one-million-tonne-a-year operation is expected to produce some 15 000 t/y of mixed rare earths carbonate, and about 8 850 t/y of total rare-earth oxides over ten years, with Hastings expected to spend some A$427-million to bring the project on line. Hastings executive chairperson Charles Lew said on Tuesday that the grant of the environmental approval meant that the company had now received the key environmental permit required to move forward on the project to produce a mixed rare earth carbonate on site. “We are excited to reach this next major milestone in the development of the Yangibana rare earths project. This environmental permit demonstrates that the Yangibana project will not have a significant impact on the environment by implementing commitments in the environmental review document and the conditions of the ministerial statement. “Hastings is on track to construct and operate a rare earths mining operation that will contribute to a more sustainable use of energy world wide and be part of the e-mobility revolution.”
