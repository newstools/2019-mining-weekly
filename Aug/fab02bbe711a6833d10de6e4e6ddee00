In a visit to rural Nevada to engage with stakeholders and communities, US Senator Catherine Masto visited the Nevada Gold Mines headquarters in Elko on Monday, meeting with senior leadership and employees. Masto’s scheduled visit comes only days after a contractor bus carrying Nevada Gold Mines employees was involved in a head-on crash with an ore truck, killing the bus driver and a passenger. Elko Daily Free Press reports that there six people were injured, five of whom were still in a serious conditions on Monday. The head-on collision on Saturday happened on the State Route 766, which leads to several mines operated by Nevada Gold Mines. Meanwhile, Masto’s visit was aimed at learning more about the social and economic benefits generated by the Nevada Gold Mines – a joint venture between gold majors Barrick Gold and Newmont Goldcorp. Nevada Gold Mines executive MD Greg Walker said the meeting was another step towards building and maintaining strong partnerships with key stakeholders and community organisations in northern Nevada and across the state. “The senator expressed her deepest condolences following Saturday’s terrible bus accident. Her support means a lot to everyone on our Nevada Gold Mines team, and we’d like to thank her for her kind words. We also appreciate her interest in our current and future business. With our operations and employees based here in Nevada, we are proud of our contribution to the state’s economy, as well as the ongoing development of local communities.” Last month, Nevada Gold Mines’ Cortez mine hosted US Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt.
