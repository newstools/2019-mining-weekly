Diversified miner African Rainbow Minerals (ARM) expects its headline earnings per share (HEPS) for the financial year ended June 30 to be between 2% and 10% higher year-on-year at between R25.77 and R27.79. This compares with the HEPS of R25.26 reported for the 2018 financial year. In a trading statement issued this week, the company noted that higher dollar prices for iron-ore, palladium and rhodium had more than offset lower dollar prices for manganese ore, manganese alloy, platinum and thermal coal. Earnings were also positively impacted on by a weaker rand:dollar exchange rate, while the company iron-ore division delivered its highest ever reported earnings. Basic earnings a share were, however, negatively impacted on by impairments of R1.07-billion for the Nkomati mine and R507-million for Sakura Ferroalloys. This is expected to result in a 22% to 29% decrease in basic earnings a share to between R17 and R18.66, compared with the basic earnings a share of R23.93 in the prior financial year. ARM will release its results on August 30.
