Aim-listed Bluejay Mining expects to ship 40 000 t run-of-mine ilmenite sample material for processing at its pilot plant in Quebec, Canada, within the next four weeks. The company reported on Monday that it had received an export permit from the Greenland government and that it had completed construction of a barge landing-ramp for ship loading, in Moriusaq. Bluejay CEO Roderick McIllree said the company’s focus was on completing the construction of the processing plant and the associated supporting infrastructure at its site in Canada, prior to delivery of the bulk sample material to Rio Tinto Iron and Titanium Canada’s Sorel-Tracy facility in Quebec. "We firmly believe that the testing of this material will prove to be both value-adding and transformative for the company as we progress towards commercial mining in tandem with the development of our other key projects in Greenland." The company’s flagship project is the proposed Dundas ilmenite mine.
