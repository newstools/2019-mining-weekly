PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Gold miner Kingsrose Mining has set a production target of between 9 500 oz and 11 000 oz for the six months to December, after both mining and processing operations resumed at its Way Linggo operation, in Indonesia. The guidance for the half-year ended December compared with the 18 815 oz of gold produced in the half-year to June. Operations at the project were suspended in June of this year, following a wall slippage, which sterilized some 3 500 oz of gold. Kingsrose on Thursday said that it is currently reviewing the production profile of both its Way Linggo and Talang Santo openpit operations, with a view to providing a guidance for the six months to June 2020. Mining at Way Linggo is currently set to continue until December this year, with gold production from the mine’s stockpiled ore to continue until June 2020. Kingsrose is now assessing the economics of deepening the pit in a further cutback, extending the mine life. At Talang Santo, the current pit design would see mining until December 2019, and gold production until June 2020; however, data is currently being collected for a new resource model at the operation, which could see Kingsrose evaluate opportunities to enlarge and deepen the current pit into remnant underground works. Kingsrose is also evaluating options for a new underground mine at Talang Santo, with an initial feasibility study set for completion in November this year.
