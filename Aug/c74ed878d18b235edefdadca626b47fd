PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The Western Australian Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) has again urged for public comment as the deadline for submissions to its greenhouse gas assessment guideline looms. EPA chairperson Tom Hatton on Friday said that the EPA wanted to hear from as many interested stakeholders and community members as possible on the development of its greenhose gas assessment guidance before the close of the submission period on September 2. “We are nearing the conclusion of the public round of input and I encourage anyone who would like to have input into the development of our guidelines to put a submission in.” The EPA in March this year withdrew revised guidelines on greenhouse gas emissions, which included rules that all new projects that emitted more than 100 000 t/y of carbon dioxide, should offset those emissions, after facing severe backlash from both the industry and the state government. Industry participants claimed that the revised guidelines would jeapordise billions worth of investment, and thousands of jobs. Instead, the environmental watchdog launched a 12-week consultation period with industry and community, which Hatton said would help to ensure that the assessment guidance on greenhouse gas emissions was well informed.
