ASX-listed Amani Gold has signed a new memorandum of understanding (MoU) with project owner La Société Minière De Kilo-Moto (Sokimo), to acquire six highly prospective gold exploration permits in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Sokimo holds 100% of exploration permits 11796, 11797, 11798, 11800, 11816 and 11817 for the Gada gold project, located in north-east DRC within the Niangara, Dungu and Rungu territories of the Haut Uele province. The original MoU with Bon Génie N Mining, announced in May, had been terminated as a result of due diligence enquiries and substituted with the new MoU. The board and management of Amani believe Gada offers a significant value enhancing opportunity for the company. “Given the location, geology and scale of the tenement package, as well as the early-stage assessment carried out across the project, it is clear that the package is highly prospective for gold mineralisation,” the company said in a statement on Monday. Local artisanal gold mining has been undertaken for many years within shallow pits of depths generally less than 10 m. Amani intends to conduct a modern exploration programme to determine potential target areas for systematic exploration work. “Amani has completed due diligence on the Gada gold project and we now look forward to aggressively exploring the ground under a new MoU with project owner Sokimo, our joint venture partner for Giro,” commented Amani MD Jacky Chan. Amani owns the Giro gold project, in the DRC, which is adjacent to the Gada project. “We have already planned extensive soil sampling and reverse circulation drilling programmes over several of the best prospects at Gada. Field teams have already completed channel and rock sampling of several actively worked artisanal pits, returning exceptional gold assay results.”
