Global gold major Barrick Gold has appointed Loreto Silva to its board as an independent director. An accomplished legal professional, academic and consultant, Silva is Chile’s former Minister of Public Works and the current chairperson of the board of national petroleum company ENAP. She is also a partner at the Chilean law firm of Bofill Escobar Silva Abogados. Executive chairperson John Thornton commented that her appointment would broaden the skills of the board and that it would add a fresh perspective. “We are pleased to welcome Loreto to the Barrick board, which will benefit from her significant knowledge of large-scale infrastructural projects and wide-ranging experience in legal and government affairs.” Under the leadership of Mark Bristow, who became CEO in January, Barrick has renewed its commitment to Latin America and has vowed to deal with legacy challenges in each of the countries where it has operations in the region. The group owns the troubled Pascua-Lama mine and a shareholding in the Zaldivar mine, as well as projects in Chile.
