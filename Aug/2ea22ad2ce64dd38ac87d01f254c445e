Results from a selective infill drill programme undertaken at Cora Gold’s Selin prospect, at the Sanankoro gold discovery, in southern Mali, have confirmed that oxide gold mineralisation at the prospect extends to 90 m in the southern part of the prospect. The findings are in addition to results from Cora’s ongoing reconnaissance regional exploration programme. CEO Jonathan Forster on Wednesday said the results of the infill drilling continue to demonstrate potentially economic mineralisation in the near-surface oxide portion of the Selin prospect. Infill drilling has provided a measure of the continuity of gold mineralisation at the Selin prospect, with the zone now totalling about 2 250 m in length, with oxide mineralisation extending locally up to 90 m at depth. According to Forster, the Selin prospect demonstrates potential for future extraction through low-cost openpit mining. He added that the enhanced knowledge of the continuity of oxide mineralisation significantly justified a further exploration programme to investigate the deeper sulphide mineralisation. "Reconnaissance exploration drilling has confirmed that primary, potentially economic gold structures exist in areas extending away from the Selin prospect and provide guidance for future drilling in these areas.”
