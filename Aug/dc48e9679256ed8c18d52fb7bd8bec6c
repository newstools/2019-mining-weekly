Dual-listed European Metals on Monday announced that the Czech Ministry of Environment had granted an extension to the Cinovec exploration licence that covers the two granted preliminary mining permits (PMPs). The granted PMPs gave European Metals the rights to apply for a final mining permit, but it did not allow for further drilling and as the company wished to conduct further metallurgical and measured resource drilling, the extension was sought. The company has been granted an extension until December 31, 2020, and said that the Ministry of the Environment had noted that a further extension could be granted, if needed. European Metals, listed in London and Australia, controls the exploration licences to the Cinovec lithium/tin project in the Czech Republic, which it describes as Europe's largest lithium deposit.
