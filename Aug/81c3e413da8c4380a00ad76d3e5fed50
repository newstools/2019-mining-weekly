Mining operations have resumed in the northern pits of the Rosebel gold mine, in Suriname, but active operations in the southern pits, along with mine development activities at Saramacca joint venture (JV) project, remain suspended. Canadian miner Iamgold earlier this month suspended operations at Rosebel, after an illegal miner gained access to the site and died following an incident with police. The Toronto-based miner said on Monday that mining had restarted in the northern pits over the weekend and that work had also resumed on the Saramacca road construction. The company recently lowered its production guidance for the year to reflect the suspension of mining activities at Rosebel. The new attributable guidance is between 765 000 oz and 810 000 oz, compared with the previous forecast of 810 000 oz to 870 000 oz. Iamgold said that Saramacca's target of nominal production in the fourth quarter was not impacted. “Iamgold is continuing discussions with the government and local stakeholders, with the aim of resuming full mining operations. The company is fully committed to restarting the southern pits and recalling its contractors,” it said in a news announcement. In order to align labour levels with production guidance, 325 contractors were released on August 15.
