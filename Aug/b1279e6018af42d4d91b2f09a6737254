Platinum miner Anglo American Platinum (Amplats) on Tuesday said its subsidiary Rustenburg Platinum Mines (RPM) had completed the buyout of the Kwanda North and Central blocks prospecting rights from Atlatsa Resources. It bought the prospecting rights from Atlatsa for R300-million in cash and will, following implementation of the transaction, write off the R4.6-billion in debt owed to it by Atlatsa, including any current and further debt that may be incurred during the care and maintenance period of Bokoni mine, in Limpopo, until December 21, 2019. RMP has included the resources specified in the Central Block and Kwanda North prospecting rights into its Mogalakwena mining right. The administrative process of registration with the Mineral and Petroleum Titles Registration Office will now follow. The transaction, first announced in December 2018, formed part of a two-phase restructuring plan by Atlatsa. The second phase will involve Atlatsa buying back all common shares held by minority shareholders for R1, or C$0.09, a share, while offering an aggregate nominal cash consideration of R1 a share to RPM. Once this is complete, Atlatsa will delist from the TSX and the JSE. Atlatsa on Tuesday said it expected the delisting to be concluded on September 17. Atlatsa and RMP will each retain their holdings in the Bokoni joint venture mine.
