KALGOORLIE (miningweekly.com) â€“ Base metals miner Panoramic Resources was aiming for full production from its Savannah North orebody, in Western Australia by the end of quarter 1 in 2020. Panoramic MD Peter Harold told delegates at Diggers and Dealers, in Kalgoorlie, that first production from Savannah North has been scheduled for the fourth quarter of this year, with the company currently working to access the orebody. At full production, Savannah North is expected to produce some 10 800 t/y of nickel, 6 100 t/y of copper and 800 t/y of cobalt. Panoramic restarted mining operations at the Savannah project in December of last year, and while Harold conceded that the restart had faced a number of teething issues, including delays in recruiting staff, mobile equipment availability, and severe weather conditions, production at the operation was now ramping up. The Savannah orebody is expected to deliver some 19 800 t of contained nickel, while Savannah North is expected to deliver an estimated 88 900 t of contained nickel.
