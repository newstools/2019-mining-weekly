Platinum group metals (PGMs) miner Eastern Platinum’s (Eastplats’) retreatment project will now only reach full operation in the third quarter. The project had initially been expected to reach this target in July. Operations at the retreatment project began in December 2018 and are continuing to ramp up, Eastplats reported on Wednesday. The company earned revenue from the retreatment project of $15.8-million in the first six months of this year. Eastplats stated that its targets for the remainder of this year included the assessment of the PGM recoverability opportunities in relation to the tailings resource, as well as the assessment of the Mareesburg project and the Crocodile River Mine Zandfontein underground operations.
