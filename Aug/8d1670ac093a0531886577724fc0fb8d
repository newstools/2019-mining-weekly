LSE- and Nasdaq-listed specialist alloy producer Afarak on Wednesday warned that its financial performance for the second quarter had been adversely impacted on by the challenges at the Mogale smelter, in South Africa. Irregular supply of electricity and associated high costs have caused underperformance from the smelter, exacerbated by unfavourable macro conditions such as sustained weak ferrochrome prices and US/China trade uncertainties. Afarak in June decided to idle the two submerged arc furnaces at the Mogale smelter. The company expects to report a loss before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation for the second quarter of about €8-million. Afarak will test the smelter for impairment. A negative result requiring a write-down could have a material impact on its financial results, it warned. However, Afarak said this would be partially offset by the acquisition of the joint venture partner’s share of Synergy Africa. Afarak will publish its interim results on August 23.
