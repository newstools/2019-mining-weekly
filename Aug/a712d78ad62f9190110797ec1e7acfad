London-listed Acacia Mining has received the go-ahead to resume gold exports from the North Mara mine, in Tanzania, nearly a month after it was ordered to suspend shipments from its largest mine. The company said on Monday that the Mining Commission of the Tanzanian Ministry of Minerals last week authorised gold exports to resume, following an investigation at the mine on July 30 and 31. The commission on July 12 suspended gold shipments from North Mara pending the investigation. Acacia was ordered to stop using its tailings storage facility, which forced the mine to stop gold production. The commission has requested Acacia to submit a feasibility study report and current mine plan for North Mara by August 16. Acacia is facing significant trouble in Tanzania, which prompted its largest shareholder, Barrick Gold, to take charge of negotiations with the government to reach a resolution of various disputes. The gold miner in July recommended Barrickâ€™s takeover offer of 232p a share, following a two-month standoff.
