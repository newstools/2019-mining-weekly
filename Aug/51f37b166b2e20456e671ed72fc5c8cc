PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Iron-ore miner Atlas Iron has extended ASX-listed BGC Contracting’s mining contract at the Mt Webber project, in Western Australia, until the end of the mine life in June 2022. Under the contract, BGC Contracting will continue to provide a range of mining services including drilling, blasting, loading, hauling, dumping and mineral processing for the operation. BGC Contracting’s CEO Greg Heylen said the new contract signifies a strong vote of confidence in the company’s ability to deliver well into the future and believed Atlas Iron’s senior team had recognised BGC Contracting’s commitment to work in alignment with its brand pillars of project delivery, strong relationships and great people. “BGC’s long standing relationship with Atlas Iron has seen the two companies work collaboratively over the better part of the last decade.  During this time, we have continuously and reliably met Atlas Iron’s safety and production targets,” Heylen said. “Through the various challenges posed by the mining cycles over the years, the one thing that has remained constant is we have maintained our strong relationship with Atlas Iron at all levels of the organisation and continue to deliver great outcomes for their projects.”
