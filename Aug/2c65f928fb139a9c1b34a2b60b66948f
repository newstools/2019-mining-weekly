PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The New South Wales government on Wednesday granted critical status to a liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminal at Newcastle. The terminal, if approved, would significantly increase the local gas supply, promote competition between suppliers and put downward pressure on the state’s gas prices, and could supply up to 80% of New South Wales’ gas needs. Acting Premier John Barilaro said the proposed A$589-million gas import terminal at Koorangang Island would include a connecting pipeline to the existing New South Wales gas supply network. “The terminal could be operational by 2022/23, and provide supply for gas-fired power stations, helping to manage energy security during the period in which the Liddell power station is scheduled to close. “This LNG terminal would significantly address this risk and help secure a reliable and affordable future for New South Wales’ gas supply.” The proponent Newcastle GasDock Company, will need to prepare an environmental impact statement for the project, which will be subject to public comment, with the Department of Planning, Industry and Environment then assessing the merits of the project before making a recommendation.
