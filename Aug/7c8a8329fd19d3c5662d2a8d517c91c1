ASX- and LSE-listed Danakali has obtained formal credit approval from the Africa Finance Corporation (AFC) and African Export Import Bank (Afreximbank) to provide the Colluli Mining Share Company (CMSC) with $200-million in senior debt finance. The facility will be part of the overall project funding package for the development and construction of the Colluli potash project, in the Danakali Depression region of Eritrea. The facility, funded equally by AFC and Afreximbank, remains subject to the completion of final documentation and will be subject to conditions precedent to drawdown. It will be underwritten by the mandated lead arrangers and includes a formal approval of export credit support from the Export Credit Insurance Corporation of South Africa (ECIC). The transaction will represent the first time the ECIC has provided export credit support to a non-South African bank. CMSC and the mandated lead arrangers will now proceed to final documentation and the execution of the facility, which is on track to be the first mining senior debt project financing drawdown in Eritrea. Commenting on the transaction, Danakali CEO Niels Wage says the final credit approval represents “outstanding progress” and a significant derisking milestone for the Colluli project financing.
