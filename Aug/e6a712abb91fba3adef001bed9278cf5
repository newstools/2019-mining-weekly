PERTH (miningweekly.com) – US energy major Chevron and its joint venture (JV) partners at the Gorgon liquefied natural gas (LNG) project, in Western Australia, have launched the world’s largest greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation project. “We are pleased to reach the first milestone of safely starting the operation of the Gorgon carbon dioxide (CO2) injection system, one of the world’s largest greenhouse gas mitigation projects ever undertaken by industry,” Chevron Australia MD Al Williams said. “This achievement is the result of strong collaboration across industry and governments and supports our objective of providing affordable, reliable and ever-cleaner energy essential to our modern lives. “We are monitoring system performance and plan to safely ramp up injection volumes over the coming months as we bring on line processing facilities.” Once fully operational, the CO2 injection facility will reduce Gorgon’s GHG emissions by about 40%, or more than 100-million tonnes over the life of the injection project. Federal Resources Minister Matt Canavan on Thursday congratulated Chevron, saying the start-up was a red-letter day for the Gorgon JV and the Australian government in realising Australia’s first large-scale carbon capture and storage project. “Once fully operational, the Gorgon CO2 injection project will make a big contribution to the government’s emission reduction goals.” The Gorgon facility incorporates several leading design features aimed at maximising energy efficiency and minimising GHG emissions, and in steady-state operations, is anticipated to have the lowest GHG emissions intensity of any LNG project in Australia.
