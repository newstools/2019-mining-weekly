PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Oil and gas major Woodside has reported first oil from the Greater Enfield project, offshore Western Australia, flowing through the Ngujima-Yin floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel. CEO Peter Coleman said this week that the first oil from Greater Enfield was produced on schedule and under budget. “The subsea campaign and refurbishment of the Ngujima-Yin FPSO was a significant undertaking and the project team and our contractors should be proud of their achievement. A highlight included performing over five-million work hours in the shipyard without a recordable safety incident.” Coleman said that the delivery of the Greater Enfield project also demonstrated Woodside’s capacity to execute the major projects that will underpin the company’s next phase of growth. Production from the $1.9-billion project is an important contribution to Woodside’s targeted annual production of around 100-million barrels of oil equivalent by 2020.
