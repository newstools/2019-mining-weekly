TSX- and ASX-listed Champion Iron’s Bloom Lake mine has shipped its tenth million tonne of high-grade 66.2% iron concentrate from the Port of Sept-Îles multi-user terminal, less than 18 months after it was recommissioned and achieved full nameplate capacity within its first year of operation. Full nameplate capacity for Bloom Lake is 7.4-million tonnes a year and allows Champion to benefit from access to a deep-water terminal where a cape-size vessel can be loaded in less than 40 hours. The delivery and sale of the Bloom Lake high-grade iron-ore concentrate to end-users in Asia, Europe and the Middle East is being completed at a time of rising demand for high-grade iron-ore concentrate with low impurities, a statement on Monday said. "The ten-millionth tonne is a significant milestone for our company after recommissioning the Bloom Lake mine in February 2018,” commented CEO David Cataford, who noted that the company had a “leading role” in the development of the Labrador Trough, a region that is said to have the capacity to handle the proposed Phase 2 expansion of Bloom Lake. The feasibility study for the Phase 2 expansion envisions doubling Bloom Lake’s overall capacity from 7.4-million tonnes a year to 15-million tonnes a year of 66.2% iron content concentrate. The miner has made available a C$68-million budget to advance the project during the remainder of the year.
