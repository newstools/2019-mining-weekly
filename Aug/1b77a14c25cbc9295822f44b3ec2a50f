Ahead of the release of its results for the six months ended June 30, next week, JSE- and NYSE-listed Gold Fields on Thursday advised shareholders that it expected to report headline earnings per share (HEPS) of $0.05. This is lower than the HEPS of $0.08 reported for the six months ended June 30, 2018. The lower HEPS relate to a restatement of the gain on the disposal of investments, said Gold Fields. The company added that basic earnings and normalised earnings were not affected by this adjustment and were expected to be within originally guided ranges. Gold Fields will release its interim results on August 15.
