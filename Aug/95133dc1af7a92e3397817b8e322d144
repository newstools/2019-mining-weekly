Construction of the Gunnison project, in southern Arizona, is nearing completion and TSX-listed Excelsior Mining has confirmed that first copper production will be achieved in the fourth quarter. Excelsior CEO Stephen Twyerould reported on Wednesday that the overall construction of the project was more than 90% finished and that the remaining elements would be completed over the next month. The company has recently completed the pipeline corridor at the project. Construction of a two-mile high-density polyethylene (HDPE) pipeline corridor connecting the Johnson Camp Mine (JCM) processing facility to the production wellfield began in January. Construction of the pipeline corridor included the installation of a bridge over an area of the property where elevation is required, and a 460-foot tunnel under the I-10 highway. The pipeline corridor contains 18-inch- and 20-inch- diameter PLS and raffinate lines, as well as a freshwater line and a utility line. Excelsior's North Star deposit contains a measured and indicated copper resource of 4.99-billion pounds (873-million tons grading 0.29%). The North Star deposit is located immediately adjacent to JCM, which Excelsior purchased out of receivership in 2015 for $8.4-million. Gunnison is an in-situ recovery copper extraction project that is permitted for 125-million pounds a year of copper cathode production.
