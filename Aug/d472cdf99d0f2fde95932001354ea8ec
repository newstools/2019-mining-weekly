PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Australian Pacific Coal on Tuesday expressed its disappointment in the Independent Planning Commission’s (IPC’s) decision not to extend the mine life of the Dartbrook coal mine, saying it would "carefully review and consider" the reasons for the decision, and evaluate its available options. The IPC at the end of last week gave the green light for Australian Pacific Coal to restart underground operations at Dartbrook, in New South Wales, using bord and pillar mining. However, the miner’s request to have the mining approval modified to extend the mine life by five years, until December 2027, was dismissed, meaning that the project would only be operational until December 2022. Australian Pacific previously said that the five-year extension of the project approval was necessary to support the capital expenditure required to recommission the project. Executive chairperson John Robinson on Tuesday said that the determination of the approval modification had taken several months, and while the main elements of mining and transport for the mine had been approved, it was ‘disappointing’ that the IPC did not approve the additional five year mine life. “The application was subject to significant support and scrutiny from the local community and we will endeavour to work closely with all stakeholders as we embark on the next phase for Dartbrook,” he said.
