An electrical equipment failure at the Trail Operations zinc refinery on Sunday could cost base metals miner Teck Resources between 20 000 t and 30 000 t in lost production. The dual listed miner reported on Monday that the equipment failure at the British Columbia-based refinery affected one of four rectifiers and that production would be reduced by about 25% while repairs were under way. Repairs would take up to 20 weeks and would cost Teck between $5-million and $10-million. Last year, the Trail Operations produced 302 900 t of refined zinc and its guidance for 2019, provided last month, is to produce between 305 000 t to 310 000 t. There were no injuries or environmental impacts related to the failure.
