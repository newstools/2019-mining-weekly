PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Gold developer Metminco has announced a number of board changes following the successful takeover of Andes Resources. Andes MD Jason Stirbinskis has been appointed as MD to Metminco, while Andes chairperson Ross Ashton has been appointed as a nonexecutive director. Metminco executive chairperson Kevin Wilson has resigned from that role, but has been appointed as nonexecutive chairperson. Meanwhile, nonexecutive directors Roger Higgins and Glenister Lamont have both resigned from the Metminco board, along with joint company secretary Geoff Widmer, who will be replaced by Julia Beckett. Andrew Metcalfe will remain as joint company secretary. Wilson on Friday said that the successful completion of the Andes acquisition transformed Metminco, with the company now requiring an experienced executive team to maximise its potential. “As the new MD, Stirbinskis brings a breadth of experience to the task and Ashton adds knowledge of operating on Colombia to the board.” Andes holds a portfolio of gold/silver/copper exploration projects in the Cauca Valley, in Colombia, which is in close proximity to Metminco’s existing mineral resource of some 877 000 oz of gold and reserves of 457 000 oz at its Miraflores deposit, as well as its Tesorito prospect and the large undrilled Chuscal target, which is in joint venture with gold miner AngloGold Ashanti.
