Nevada Governor Steve Sisolak has jointed gold major Barrick president and CEO Mark Bristow for a visit to the site of the Cortez mine, which forms part of the joint venture with top gold miner Newmont Goldcorp. Sisolak also joined Bristow for a meeting of local, regional and tribal leaders in Elko on Tuesday, where the stakeholders were updated about Nevada Gold Mines. “This joint venture positions northern Nevada as the world’s greatest gold mining complex. Our company is proud to be part of a joint investment with Newmont Goldcorp in Nevada Gold Mines. We see this massive investment in Nevada and its world-class mining industry enduring for decades to come. There’s a reason why Nevada is ranked as one of the more attractive jurisdictions in the world for mining investment. It’s not only the geological attractiveness, but that we have a true partnership with the state and federal government in growing a responsible, safe, and beneficial industry for our local communities,” he said in a statement, issued on Wednesday. The new company, owned 61.5% and operated by Barrick, and owned 38.5% by Newmont Goldcorp, officially launched on July 1.
