PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Australian Energy Minister Angus Taylor has established an inquiry into the nuclear fuel cycle, and the potential use of nuclear energy in Australia. “The committee will be asking a range of questions to establish whether nuclear energy would be feasible and suitable for Australia with account for economic, environmental and safety issues,” said committee chair Ted O’Brien. “There are new and emerging forms of nuclear energy technology that are very different from the old smoke stack reactors people tend to picture when they think nuclear energy and it’s on these newer technologies that we’ll focus. “Our job will be to determine the circumstances under which future Coalition or Labor governments might consider nuclear energy generation.” Taylor said in an interview on Monday that there was "absolutely no plan" to lift the current moratorium on nuclear power, but noted that the government was required to look at alternative technologies as part of its longer-term views. The Minerals Council of Australia has welcomed the inquiry, with CEO Tania Constable saying it was an important first step in starting a mature fact-based national conversation for the Australian community. “The rest of the world is already focusing on the critical role nuclear energy will play in delivering zero-emission, 24/7 energy to a power-hungry world. Nuclear energy is safe, reliable and affordable. “With 30% of the world’s known uranium reserves and as the third largest uranium producer, Australia will be critical to helping the world meet its need for electricity while also reducing emissions.” She added that by initiating an inquiry into nuclear power, the federal government was allowing the Australian community to have an honest discussion regarding the role existing and new nuclear technologies like small modular reactors could play in addressing Australia’s medium- and long-term energy challenges.
