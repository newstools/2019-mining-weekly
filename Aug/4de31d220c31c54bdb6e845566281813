TSX-listed gold miner Semafo on Tuesday reported a pit wall failure at the Wona pit of its Mana mine, in Burkina Faso, and advised that it expected the mine to produce 40 000 oz to 50 000 oz less gold this year as a result. The company confirmed that, at the time of the incident, no mining was under way in the area and that no one was injured. The pit wall failure occurred on Friday last week, and the company has been assessing the impact. Although there was mining activity in the southern part of Wona pit, mining from the northern part of the pit where the collapse occurred was only expected from late August. “To mine securely and regain access to ore in Wona North, we will have to push back the pit wall and mine about six-million tonnes of waste material. As a result, mining of ore in the northern part of the pit will be deferred until the first quarter of 2020. “These six-million tonnes were part of the life-of-mine plan in 2021 and therefore do not represent additional tonnes or cost,” said Semafo. Semafo further said that, after evaluating multiple scenarios to compensate for the ore from Wona North this year, there would be insufficient ore to feed the mill for about ten weeks. “We now expect to suspend the processing of ore at Mana between mid-August and the end of October.” Semafo’s guidance has been revised to between 130 000 oz and 140 000 oz, compared with the prior target of between 170 000 oz and 190 000 oz. Meanwhile, the mine plan for the Siou pit remains unchanged, with ore expected in the fourth quarter, while development of the Siou underground operation remains on time and within budget.
