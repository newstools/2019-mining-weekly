PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Gold miner Saracen Mineral Holdings has completed the acquisition of Bligh Resources, netting that company’s major shareholder, Zeta Resources a 260% premium on its initial A$9-million investment cost. Saracen in June launched a A$38.2-million all-scrip takeover offer for fellow-listed Bligh Resources, which holds the Bundarra gold project, some 30 km south of Saracen’s own Thunderbox project. The project consists of five mining leases and six prospecting licences hosting four gold deposits, with a Joint Ore Reserves Committee-compliant resource of some 9.7-million tonnes, grading 2.1 g/t gold for 66 000 oz of contained gold. Zeta Resources received more than 9.36-million new shares in Saracen for its 87% interest in Bligh.
