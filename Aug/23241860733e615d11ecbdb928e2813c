PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The Western Australian government on Tuesday announced a new guidance for the rehabilitation of mine sites in the region.  The guidance outlines environmental criteria that mine operators can use to demonstrate they have successfully and sustainably rehabilitated their site after mining.  The work is the first in Australia to be produced by government agencies, leading science experts and a wide range of industry representatives, Mines and Petroleum Minister Bill Johnston said on Tuesday. “The new Western Australian guidance for mine closure is a great example of government and industry working together to deliver better rehabilitation outcomes for our state.  “It provides industry with greater clarity and consistency in the development of mine closure plans across different locations and commodities.”  He noted that while the new guidance primarily target the resources sector, other industries could potentially use the guidance when undertaking ecological restoration. "Effective mine closure is critical to ensure the long-term environmental sustainability of the industry,” Johnston said.
