All the conditions to complete the 2017 strategic agreement between Canada’s Centerra Gold and Kyrgyzstan have been satisfied, the gold mining company announced on Wednesday, sending its stock on the Toronto exchange up nearly 5% to C$11.65 a share. The parties reached an agreement relating to the Kumtor mine in September 2017, resolving issues including environmental and profit-sharing disputes. The deal was expected to close in May 2018, but its completion has been pushed out several times. With the first completion date having occurred, Centerra said that it was now moving to terminate the remaining legal proceedings affecting the Kumtor project, in particular the international proceedings at the Permanent Court of Arbitration, as well as certain civil proceedings. The second completion date, which is when arbitration and civil proceedings are terminated, would occur in the third quarter of this year. By then, Centerra’s Kyrgyz subsidiary, Kumtor Gold Company would make payments required under the strategic agreement, including to the Kyrgyz Republic Nature Development Fund and Cancer Care Support Fund. Centerra’s subsidiary has also committed to additional contributions over and above those required in the strategic agreement to “strengthen its social licence to operate”, including a $5-million lump sum contribution to a new Kyrgyz Republic Social Partnership for Regional Development Fund within five business days of the second completion date, a $5-million lump sum contribution to the fund within 12 months of the second completion date, monthly contributions to the regional fund equivalent to 0.4% of Kumtor’s revenues, a yearly contribution of $1-million to the Kyrgyz Republic Nature Development Fund, and exploration expenditures of at least $16-million at the Kumtor project over a two-year period. “The deadline for completion of the strategic agreement was extended several times while the parties worked together to satisfy all of the conditions to completion and we have reached this stage due to the commitment of the government to ensure business certainty for Kumtor and its future mining operations,” said Centerra president and CEO Scott Perry.
