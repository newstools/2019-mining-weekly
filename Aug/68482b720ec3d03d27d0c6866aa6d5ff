TSX-V-listed Minera Alamos on Thursday announced that the Mexico federal agency, Semarnat, had approved the environmental impact statement for the Santana gold project. The permit, together with the change of land use notification received in June, now provides the company with the key approvals necessary for the construction of a commercial-scale mine and gold heap-leach processing facility. The project still required “lesser permits”, covering activities such as water use and explosives, but with the key permits in hand, the company could start earthwork and construction activities in advance of mining operations. Minera Alamos plans to initiate construction activities late this year with first gold production planned mid-2020. “We are extremely proud of our technical team’s efforts to successfully obtain operating permits for the Santana project in a little over a year following their submission,” commented Minera Alamos CEO Darren Koningen.
