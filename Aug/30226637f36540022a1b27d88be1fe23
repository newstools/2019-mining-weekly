Mining company African Rainbow Minerals (ARM) said on Friday its revenue increased by five percent to R9.595 billion in the year ended June, while headline earnings per share were up nine percent to R27.18. ARM declared a final dividend of 900 cents, which together with an interim dividend of 400 cents per share paid in April brings the total dividend for the year to 1,300 cents. The company said engagements with affected stakeholders were under way after an agreement to scale down the loss-making Nkomati mine was reached by the joint venture partners.
