US-based Mexus Gold CEO Paul Thompson has hailed the first gold pour at the company’s Santa Elena mine, in Mexico, as a “monumental moment” that had followed “years of ups and downs”. The junior announced on Monday that it had recovered gold from its first heap leach pad using its Merrill Crowe gold recovery system. The remaining precipitate smelting would take five days. “This is a monumental moment for Mexus. It has taken years with many ups and downs, but through hard work and the dedication of our staff we’ve been able to meet this long sought-after goal. Mexus looks forward to building out the Santa Elena mine,” said Thompson. Mexus continued to mine and crush ore for the second lift on heap leach pad number one and said that it expected to stay ahead of mining fresh ore for the pad, allowing for uninterrupted leaching and gold recovery.
