KALGOORLIE (miningweekly.com) – Diamond miner Lucapa Diamond Company has recovered a 64 ct diamond from its Mothae kimberlite mine, in Lesotho. The Type IIa D-colour gem is considered to be the best individual diamond recovered to date from the Mothae mine, Lucapa MD Stephen Wetherall said on Tuesday. “The recovery of this exceptional 64 ct gem also represents a great start to our mining campaign in the higher margin zones in the southern pit at Mothae,” Wetherall said.
