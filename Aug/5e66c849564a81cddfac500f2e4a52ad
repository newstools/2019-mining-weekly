London-listed Acacia Miningâ€™s North Mara gold mine has resumed the export of gold, after receiving export permits from the Mining Commission of the Tanzanian Ministry of Minerals. Following the sale of this gold, the company will be able to meet its financial obligations for an extended period, the gold miner said in a statement on Friday. However, the company noted that since the prohibition notice issued by the Tanzanian National Environment Management Council came into effect, which ordered the North Mara mine to stop use of its tailings storage facility on July 20, all gold production at the processing plant had ceased. Production at the plant would not resume until the notice was lifted. Mining activities at North Mara, however, remained unaffected for the time being with mined ore being added to stockpiles, while a resolution was sought with respect to the notice.
