Coca-Cola Beverages South Africa (CCBSA) has been nominated for the Top Gender Empowered Organisation: Business of the Year award, in the sixteenth annual Standard Bank Top Women Awards, while two Exxaro employees have been named finalists for Woman of the Year awards. The Standard Bank Top Women Awards is one of South Africa’s most prestigious gender-empowerment events, recognising organisations and individuals whose efforts uplift women in business and society. The awards ceremony will take place on August 15. Topco Media has named CCBSA as one of five finalists for the Business of the Year award, since the company has shown consistent dedication to driving gender parity. “We are proud of our work in developing not only our own women staff to key leadership positions at all levels of our operations, but also investing in women entrepreneurs to become integral partners, particularly through our Owner Driver Scheme and Local Distribution Programme,” says CCBSA MD Velaphi Ratshefola. Meanwhile, Leeuwpan coal mine plant manager Johanne Struwig and engineering manager Bontle Mtshengu are the Exxaro employees who are finalists for the awards. Struwig is a finalist in the Top Young Achiever of the Year category, while Mtshengu has been shortlisted in the Top Gender Empowered Organisation: Resources category. “Both ladies are exemplary employees who are valued members of the management team. The nomination is testament to the work that Exxaro is doing to power better lives for our female employees,” said Exxaro Leeuwpan coal mine business unit manager Mangaliso Sethethi.
