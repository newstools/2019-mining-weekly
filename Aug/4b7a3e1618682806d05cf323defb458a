Aim- and TSX-V-quoted Galantas Gold on Tuesday announced a private placement of common shares to raise up to £1-million, or C$1.6-million, to fund optimisation efforts at the Omagh gold mine, in Northern Ireland. The private placement is expected to include funds raised in UK and Canadian currency and is for a maximum of 23 529 412 shares, at an issue price of £0.0425, or C$0.068 a share. The optimisation efforts include increased mechanisation and improved underground infrastructure, Galantas said in a statement. The underground gold mine at Omagh has started limited production of gold concentrate, from feed produced in development of the Kearney vein. The processing plant uses a nontoxic flotation process to produce concentrates, without the use of cyanide or mercury.
