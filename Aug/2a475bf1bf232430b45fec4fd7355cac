Canada’s Natural Resources Minister, Amarjeet Sohi, has announced a $2-million investment in a Canada Mining Innovation Council-led initiative to develop technology that will reduce energy consumption at mine sites. The project will aim to replace conventional crushers with technology that can reduce the crushing and grinding component of a mining site’s energy consumption by up to 50%, lowering costs by 30%. Crushing and grinding rocks into smaller pieces is the most energy-consuming activity in a mining operation. This project is funded through Natural Resources Canada's Clean Growth Program, which invests in clean technology research and development projects in Canada's energy, mining and forest sectors. The programme is a C$155-million investment fund that helps emerging clean technologies further reduce their impacts on air, land and water, while enhancing competitiveness and creating jobs.
