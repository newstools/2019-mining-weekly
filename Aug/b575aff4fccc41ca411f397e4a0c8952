PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The Queensland resources sector has reaffirmed its commitment to the government’s safety reset, with the state-wide initiative having reached nearly half of the state’s 50 000-strong mine and quarry workforce. However, Mines Minister Dr Anthony Lynham has noted that only 13 days remained for another 26 000 people to complete the workplace safety sessions. “More than 23 000 workers have joined management and union representatives to take part in safety resets at more than 160 mines and quarries,” he said. “That’s a lot of people, but the commitment from companies and unions in July was that every worker, at every site, would attend a reset by the end of August. I will report to the regional Parliament in Townsville on the reset, and that includes naming any sites and their operators where workers have not had resets.” Queensland Resources Council CEO Ian Macfarlane said on Monday that the safety reset was an agreed approach between the Queensland government, industry and unions following four fatalities at mines over the last 12 months and another two fatalities at quarries over the same period. “Safety is the priority for our industry and the safety reset is an initiative to reaffirm that message at every mine site to every worker,” Macfarlane said. “The industry will continue to aim to have delivered the safety reset on all mine sites by the end of August.” As part of the safety response, the government is also recruiting three more mines inspectors and a chief inspector of coal mining.
