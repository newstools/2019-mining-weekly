Aim- and FSE-listed Bluejay Mining has announced the appointment of Danish geologist Dr Bo Stensgaard to its board as an executive director. Stensgaard, who has extensive operational experience in Greenland, joined Bluejay in September last year as general manager. “We believe Bo's considerable in-country experience of more than 20 years, paired with his excellent and detailed knowledge of the Dundas project, will add further expertise to the board of directors. Since joining the company in 2018 in his position as general manager, Bo has been working closely with the board advising on operational performance and other development initiatives, and as such this appointment feels like an extremely natural progression for Bluejay,” commented Bluejay CEO Roderick McIllree. Bluejay is preparing to ship its first bulk sample from Dundas to Canada for testing at Rio Tinto Iron and Titanium Canada’s Sorel-Tracy facility in Quebec.
