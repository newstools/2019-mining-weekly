ASX-listed RBR Group has started training prospective workers for jobs that will become available at Mozambique’s emerging liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects. As part of its strategy to assess, train and provide workers for the LNG projects, the labour and training specialist has opened a training centre in Palma, Mozambique, which is located close to the LNG construction sites. The centre will train Mozambican citizens from the local stakeholder communities, with the aim of creating employment opportunities for them in semiskilled and skilled roles. RBR subsidiary Futuro Skills Mozambique, which will run the facility, has the relevant Engineering Construction Industry Training Board (ECITB) accreditation in five of the technical disciplines required for the construction activities.
 
Staff and equipment have been allocated and initial activities will focus on helping workers secure the internationally-recognised ECITB International Health and Safety Passport, as well as a range of skills relevant to the activities taking place in the region.
  
RBR has already received expressions of interest from contractors operating in the area which are seeking to hire the graduates as they become available.
