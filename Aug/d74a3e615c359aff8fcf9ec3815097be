JOHANNESBURG â€“ Sibanye-Stillwater is in talks over a potential acquisition of the world's deepest gold mine, Mponeng, as current owner AngloGold Ashanti plans its South African exit, Sibanye said on Thursday. A spokesperson for the diversified miner confirmed the talks, after AngloGold said in May that it would review divestment options for Mponeng and other South African assets to focus on higher returns elsewhere. "We have said we are open minded to the opportunity," Sibanye CE Neal Froneman said. "We are not panting after more deep-level gold mines but there are significant synergies and opportunities between Driefontein and Mponeng." He declined to comment further due to a nondisclosure agreement.
