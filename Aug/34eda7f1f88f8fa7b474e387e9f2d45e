The completion of the preliminary economic assessment (PEA) of the Coringa gold project, in north-central Brazil, had been delayed to the end of month, Aim- and TSX-listed Serabi Gold reported on Monday. The company initially aimed to release the results of the PEA this week, but consultants Global Resource Engineering (GRE) had requested further time to complete their work, owing to a decision to switch to dry stacking and to do away with a conventional dam. This impacted on the process flowsheet design. Serabi said that GRE had undertaken to deliver the results before the end of August. “Whilst we had planned for to be able to issue the results of the PEA during this week, we expect the delay in completion will be limited, and look forward to the publication of the PEA results later this month,” said CEO Mike Hodgson.
