KALGOORLIE (miningweekly.com) â€“ Gold miners Gold Road Resources and Gold Fields have started ramping up the Gruyere gold project, in Western Australia, to nameplate capacity.

The joint venture (JV) partners have completed the commissioning of the final components of the process plant, with both the ball mill and gravity circuit now operational. Gruyere poured its first gold at the start of July this year, with the project expected to produce between 75 000 oz and 100 000 oz of gold in the 2019 calendar year. Cost guidance for the year will be reviewed once commercial production is declared, which is currently expected to be mid-way through the six- to seven-month ramping up period. Life-of-mine average annual production at Gruyere is expected to be around 300 000 oz/y at an average all-in sustaining cost of around A$1 025/t over the 12-year mine life.
