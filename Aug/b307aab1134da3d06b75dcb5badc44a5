Civil rights organisation AfriForum has intensified its efforts to halt the development of a planned coal mine near the Kruger National Park after the organisation became aware of alleged violations by Singo Consulting, which had been appointed by Manzolwandle Investments to undertake an environmental-impact assessment (EIA) for the project. AfriForum on Wednesday laid a criminal charge against Singo at the Komatipoort police station, in Mpumalanga, stating that Singo had allegedly committed plagiarism in the EIA. AfriForum said it had been informed that Singo’s EIA report matched that of other environmental consultants working on other projects “word for word”. AfriForum’s legal team would submit complaints to the relevant councils with which Singo was registered and accredited. “I believe that more violations will come to light with an in-depth investigation. Up to now, we have not been truly informed of events, while the processes being followed are insufficient,” said AfriForum environmental affairs head Lambert de Klerk. He noted that the organisation had also investigated the registered address of Singo and Manzolwandle. He pointed out that the mining company’s address was not listed in the EIA report and that that field had, instead, been left open. “How can a mining company apply for a mining licence if you can not even visit their offices?” Manzolwandle wants to start mining for coal on an 18 000 ha area near the Kruger National Park. This would hold “enormous disadvantages and destructive consequences for the immediate environment, the Crocodile river and other water sources, nature reserves, wildlife, the road network in Mpumalanga and agricultural activities”, AfriForum stated.
