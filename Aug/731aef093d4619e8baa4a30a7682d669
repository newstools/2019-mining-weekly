Aim-listed BlueRock Diamonds, which operates the Kareevlei mine, in the Kimberley region of South Africa, sold a 7.63 ct diamond for $52 000 during its August tender. This is the company’s fifth diamond to sell for more than $50 000 this year. “The continued and improving regularity of discovery of high-quality stones underpins the potential value of the project and the effectiveness of our recent improvements in operational practises,” BlueRock executive chairperson Mike Houston commented in a statement issued on Monday.
