Exploration company SolGold, which is advancing the Cascabel project in Ecuador, is expanding its drilling fleet to expedite its prefeasibility study (PFS) of the Alpala deposit by the end of the first quarter next year. The Brisbane, Australia-based company will have a total of 15 drill rigs active on Cascabel by next month to expedite the data collection ahead of the Alpala PFS deadline, the Toronto- and London-listed company said on Friday. Currently, the 2019 drilling campaign is using only ten drilling rigs, comprising nine man-portable machines and one large track-mounted machine. The fleet is deployed as seven rigs focusing on resource extension and infill drilling and three rigs focusing on geotechnical, hydrogeological and sterilisation drilling. A further four man-portable rigs are currently under construction in Ecuador, one of which will arrive this month and the rest in September and October. A specialised hydrological drilling contractor has been signed to supply a further two drilling rigs for groundwater drilling and water testing. Meanwhile, SolGold said that it would announce a third mineral resource estimate for the Alpala deposit in the second half of this year to include the additional 68Â 354 m of assayed drilling completed since the release of the second resource estimate. The third resource estimate would form the basis of the PFS.
