ASX-listed Pensana Metals on Thursday reported that its COO Dave Hammond had mobilised two drill rigs and a large excavator for a bulk sample as part of a prefeasibility study and the later front-end engineering design of the Longonjo rare earths project, in Angola.
 
The data being gathering from waterbore drilling and geotechnical trenching will be used in the final design for water sourcing and the siting of key infrastructure.
 
Hammond is also excavating a 60 t bulk sample of the section of the high-grade mineralisation scheduled for first production for detailed testwork in specialised laboratories in Australia.
 
“It’s great to be back and get the big kit on site for the first ground breaking.
 
"The information we are gathering from the waterbore drilling, geotechnical trenching and the bulk sample collection are vital to the studies needed for fast-tracked production,” Hammond commented.
