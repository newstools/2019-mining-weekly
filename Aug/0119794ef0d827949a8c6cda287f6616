The organiser of Nigeria Mining Week, Spintelligent, has welcomed the newly appointed Nigerian Mines and Steel Development Minister Olamilekan Adegbite. Spintelligent says he holds the key to driving the renewal of the country’s mining sector. Adegbite succeeds Kayode Fayemi, who held the ministerial position from 2015 to 2018. Spintelligent mining director Emmanuelle Nicholls remarks that the global mining community is now paying attention to the renaissance of mining in Nigeria and its interest continues to increase. “Mining is fast becoming the industry of repute and promise for the diversification of the Nigerian economy.” The Nigerian Ministry of Mines and Steel Development is the official host ministry partner of the annual Nigeria Mining Week conference and expo, taking place from October 14 to 16 in Abuja. The organiser expects this year’s conference will attract more than 1 200 mining experts, about 180 mining and exploration companies and more than 40 sponsors, from about 24 countries.
