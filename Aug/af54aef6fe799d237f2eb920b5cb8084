ASX- and LSE-listed MOD Resources has made progress with the permitting process for its T3 Copper openpit mine, in Botswana. MOD, through its subsidiary Tshukudu Metals Botswana, will formally release the environmental- and social-impact assessment for the mine for public review. This follows after the Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA) completed its assessment. Parties who may be impacted by the proposed T3 mine have four weeks to submit comments to the DEA. Following the review period, Tshukudu should be in a position to apply for a mining licence. MOD MD Julian Hanna says the T3 Copper mine is expected to be a significant contributor to the local Ghanzi economy. Meanwhile, the DEA has also provided comments on the company’s environmental management plan (EMP) for the expansion of the Ghanzi accommodation camp to accommodate the T3 project’s construction. MOD and Tshukudu will assess the comments and submit a revised draft of the plan to the DEA in the coming weeks. If the EMP is approved, the accommodation camp will be expanded to accommodate up to 400 personnel.
