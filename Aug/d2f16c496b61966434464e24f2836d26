PERTH (miningweekly.com) â€“ Joint venture (JV) partners Gold Fields and Gold Road Resources are progressing with the ramp-up of the Gruyere mill, in Western Australia, with the circuit achieving 96 hours of continuous operation. The two companies on Thursday said that a total of 73 590 t of ore were processed at an average recovery of 94.8% and an average grade of 1.17 g/t gold over this period, with the throughput rate managed at an average of 725 t/h. Since the start of mining, until the end of July, some 3.4-million tonnes of ore has been mined, grading 0.83 g/t gold for 90 700 contained ounces.
