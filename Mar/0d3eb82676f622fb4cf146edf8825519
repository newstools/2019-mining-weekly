Under the terms of a JV agreement with project owner Antipa Minerals, Rio could fund up to A$60-million in exploration expenditure to earn a 75% interest in the multi-metals project, which is some 5km from its own Winu copper/gold/silver discovery and 80km north of gold miner Newcrest’s Telfer operation. Antipa said this week that Rio’s exploration programme for 2019 will be subject to the completion of final planning and the receipt of formal approvals by the company.
