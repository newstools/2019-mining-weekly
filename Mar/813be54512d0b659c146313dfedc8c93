LSE-listed Petra Diamonds has recovered a 100.83 ct D-colour Type II gem-quality diamond at its Cullinan mine, in South Africa. The large diamond find follows the recent recovery of a 6.12 ct Type II blue stone at the same mine. The company indicated in a statement last week that these recoveries demonstrated the prevalence of these types of stones in the Cullinan orebody, as well as the ability of the mine’s plant to recover the full spectrum of diamonds. Both stones will be included in the company’s upcoming March tender.
