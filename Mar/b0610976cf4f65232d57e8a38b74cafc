PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Birimian has received the environmental permit for its Goulamina lithium project, in Mali. “This is a significant milestone for the Goulamina project and is the culmination of a great deal of hard work on the part of the project team,” said Birimian MD Chris Evans. “We are now a large step closer to becoming the first lithium mine in Mali.” The company on Thursday told shareholders that the environmental permit included standard conditions to ensure that the company continued to maintain its high levels of environmental awareness. An updated prefeasibility study into the Goulamina project estimated that it could produce an average 362 000 t/y of spodumene concentrate, or a total of 5.7-million tonnes of concentrate over an initial mine life of 16 years, based on a two-million-tonne-a-year mineral concentrating plant. The project is estimated to have a net present value of A$653-million and an internal rate of return of 49.5%, and would require a capital investment of A$196-million.
