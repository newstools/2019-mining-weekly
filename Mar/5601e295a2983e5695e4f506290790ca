The Debswana Diamond Company (Debswana) on Monday announced the start of its Cut-9 project, which is aimed at extending the life of the Jwaneng mine, in Botswana, to 2035. The project is expected to yield an estimated 53-million carats of rough diamonds from 44-milllion tonnes of treated material. Debswana – a joint venture between the government of Botswana and De Beers Group – said it would invest about $2-billion over the life of the project. At its peak, Cut-9 is expected to create about 1 000 jobs.
