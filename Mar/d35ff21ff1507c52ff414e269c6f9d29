Aim-listed BlueRock Diamonds on Friday said it was finalising preparations for the move to continuous operations at its Kareevlei diamond mine, in Kimberley, South Africa. The company said that although this was later than had initially been anticipated, it would not have any material impact on the published production guidance of 35 000 t to 45 000 t for the first quarter. BlueRock expects production volumes for the first quarter to be near the upper end of this range.
