PERTH (miningweekly.com) – An 83 ct diamond has been recovered from the Mothae kimberlite project, in Lesotho. ASX-listed Lucapa Diamond Company on Friday said that the diamond was the fourth stone measuring larger than 50 ct to be recovered from Mothae to date, and while the 83.9 ct diamond was not considered gem-quality, it continued to underline the large-stone nature of the resource. “We are highly encouraged that the coarse size fraction in our recently commenced commercial production through the new 1.1-million-tonne-a-year Mothae plant is reinforcing why Lucapa invested in this second high-value resource to complement production from the Lulo mine in Angola,” said Lucapa MD Stephen Wetherall.
