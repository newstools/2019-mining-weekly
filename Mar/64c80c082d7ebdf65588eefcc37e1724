Aim-listed Hummingbird Resources has announced its third set of drilling results from the recently completed exploration campaign at the Yanfolila gold mine, in Mali. The drilling was aimed at converting resources to reserves and, in time, extending the mine life. Intercepts at the Gonka deposit included 18 m at 9.39 g/t gold from a 156 m depth; 4.3 m at 29.74 g/t gold from a 250 m depth; 3 m at 12.89 g/t gold from a 137 m depth; and 13.6 m at 2.56 g/t gold from a 34 m depth. The drilling programme largely focused around the resource definition at Gonka, with some further follow-up drilling at Komana West. Hummingbird reported that the latest results demonstrated high-grade potential and continued exploration potential at depth. On completion of the 2018 drilling programme, the total metres drilled was 28 349 m. The company in December announced a stand-out intercept of 15 m at 16.03 g/t gold. Hummingbird is integrating the positive results seen in its exploration programme into its mine plan. The Gonka deposit is situated 5 km from the process plant, making it suitable to be included in the current mine plan. Once resource modelling and mine planning is completed, the company can mine Gonka immediately, since it falls within the mining licence area. “A 2019 drilling programme will target the down dip extensions to Gonka to expand the resource and reserves. A thorough review of the database to identify new greenfield targets is also under way and this is expected to yield high-priority targets to drill test outside the current seven deposits that have resource associated with them,” confirmed chief geologist Murray Paterson.
