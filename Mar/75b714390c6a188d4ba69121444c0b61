The University of the Witwatersrand’s (Wits’) School of Mining Engineering has improved its standing in the global QS World University Rankings to thirteenth place, from fifteenth in 2018. Last year, the school moved up to the number 15 spot from twenty-second place in 2017. The school retains its position as the highest ranked school at Wits. It is also the only mining school on the African continent to feature in the top 50 mining schools worldwide. “This QS ranking means that, as a school, we provide an internationally competitive mining engineering curriculum. This is based on the work of our high-quality academics who produce impactful research, and our graduates who enter their careers with skills [that are] relevant to the mines of the future,” said School of Mining Engineering head Professor Cuthbert Musingwini. The QS World University Rankings use six performance indicators with different weightings to assess universities. The most important indicators are academic reputation, student-to-faculty ratio and research citations per faculty member. Other indicators include employer reputation, proportion of international faculty and proportion of international students.
