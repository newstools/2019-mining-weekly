Aim-listed Shanta Gold on Sunday intersected underground development ore at the Ilunga mine, which forms part of its New Luika gold mine complex, in Tanzania. The intersect occurred as predicted in the company’s geological model, and, notably, is three months ahead of schedule. The Ilunga mine is the third source of high-grade ore at New Luika. The company previously said that Ilunga has the potential to contribute up to 25 000 t/m of ore feed. Ilunga has a probable reserve of 660 500 t at 5.56 g/t for 118 000 oz of contained gold.
