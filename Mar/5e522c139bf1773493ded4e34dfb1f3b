As criticism mounts over Newmont’s merger with Goldcorp, the US-based gold major on Monday promised its shareholders a special dividend of $0.88 a share should they approve the $10-billion transaction at a meeting next month. CEO Gary Goldberg said that the special dividend was in “recognition of the potential synergy value” of the Nevada joint venture (JV) agreement with fellow gold major Barrick. This comes as at least two of Newmont’s shareholders, Van Eck and Paulson & Co, have said that they would not support the miner’s acquisition, as they believe it was unfair that Goldcorp shareholders should benefit from a JV with Barrick. The JV was negotiated after the Goldcorp and Newmont terms were set. “We have continued to engage with, and have listened carefully to, our shareholders,” Goldberg said in a statement on Monday, adding that “several” of the group’s largest shareholders had expressed their support for the combination. In a separate statement, Goldcorp expressed its support for the Newmont special dividend. Goldcorp shareholders will be the first to vote on the transaction on April 4 and independent proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services has recommended that shareholders approve the deal. Newmont shareholders will decide on April 11. The closing of the Newmont-Goldcorp transaction is expected to close shortly after the two shareholder special meetings, should the shareholders approve the resolutions. The transaction has already received clearance from the Canadian Competition Bureau, the Korea Fair Trade Commission and the Mexico Competition Commission.
