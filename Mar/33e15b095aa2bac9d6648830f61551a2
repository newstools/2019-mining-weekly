SAO PAULO â€“ Brazilian mining company Vale said on Friday it has formally removed some executives from their positions after a request by Brazilian prosecutors investigating a dam burst that killed hundreds of people. Vale did not identify the executives or say what relation they had with the operation in Brumadinho, where the January 25 disaster occurred. It said they would be relocated inside the company. On March 2, Vale pushed out its CEO and other senior executives as a result of the prosecutors' request.
