PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Amendments to the Northern Territory’s petroleum legislation has passed through Parliament, enacting the government’s commitment to implement the 135 recommendations from the Scientific Inquiry into Hydraulic Fracturing. “Our government is making sure that as the Territory’s onshore gas industry emerges, our unique natural environment is protected and local Territory jobs come first,” said Primary Industry and Resources Minister Paul Kirby. “It is important to implement appropriate safeguards, which is what our government is doing by implementing the 135 recommendations of the independent scientific inquiry.” The Petroleum Legislation Amendment Bill gives effect to a number of key recommendations, including creating provisions for open standing judicial review for decisions under the Petroleum Act and Petroleum Environment Regulations, and ensuring gas companies must be a “fit and proper person” to hold an exploration permit or production licence. The amendments also empowered the making of the Petroleum (Environment) Regulations and enforcing adherence to codes of practice. In particular, codes of practice will be vital to the strong regulatory regime being implemented. The codes of practice will relate to well integrity, well decommissioning and abandonment, methane monitoring, surface activities and managing wastewater, Kirby said. “[The] amendments are a significant step forward in strengthening the laws surrounding the development of the onshore gas industry in the Northern Territory. “A highly-regulated onshore gas industry can bring economic benefits to the Territory, creating jobs and attracting investment,” the Minister said. The amendments, along with the implementation of other recommendations from the Final Report of the Scientific Inquiry into Hydraulic Fracturing, will allow on-ground exploration to commence later this year.
