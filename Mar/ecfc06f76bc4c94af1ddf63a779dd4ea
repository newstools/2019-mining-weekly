The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) on Tuesday confirmed that it had met with President Cyril Ramaphosa, Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan and Energy Minister Jeff Radebe this week. The union noted, however, that it still needed to consult with its members employed at Eskom, on the contents of the meeting and to discuss a way forward. “The three-hour meeting with the President and the Ministers came after resolutions were taken earlier this month by thousands of frustrated Eskom workers. “Workers are concerned about the inconsistent messages from government with regard to the undbundling of the State-owned utility, dividing it into three entities – generation, transmission and distribution.” Eskom has, according to the NUM, been unable to explain what the unbundling would mean for workers in terms of job security. The union noted that the meeting with Ramaphosa was productive and brought some elements of hope, since the President had given his assurances that no jobs would be lost in the process of unbundling and that Eskom would remain State-owned. While the NUM fully supports government’s commitment to fix the utility, it remains opposed to any restructuring that will add to job losses. Meanwhile, the NUM’s Eskom members will go ahead with their planned march to the African National Congress’ headquarters – Luthuli House – on March 30.
