PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The world’s largest airborne electromagnetic survey has revealed potential new mineral and groundwater resources in the Northern Territory and Queensland. Federal Resources Minister Matt Canavan noted that the survey indicated the potential for new mineral deposits including gold, copper, nickel, lead, zinc and manganese, as well as critical minerals such as cobalt, platinum-group elements and rare-earth elements. “The survey containing 60 000 line kilometres of data provides new insights into mineral-rich areas in Northern Australia that have not been extensively explored previously,” Canavan said. The Minister noted that when integrated with other datasets such as gravity, magnetic and radiometric maps of Australia, the Airborne electromagnetic (AEM) surveys can reveal potential broad-scale groundwater resources to support communities, industries and the environment. “This is great news for Northern Australia, offering enormous potential for the next generation of resource discoveries.” The data has already received significant interest, with 13 exploration companies having signed up to participate in infill flying during the next survey, which will be acquired across an equally large area of the west of the Northern Territory and into Western Australia. “The Coalition government is committed to building a strong, growing economy that creates jobs, especially in Northern Australia,” Minister Canavan said. “That’s why we are investing heavily in word-class geoscience data acquisition programmes, which are central to de-risking exploration and attracting more investment, an aim outlined in the recently released Australia’s National Resources Statement. “This statement is a new national policy framework vital for planning and stability in the resources industry. The aim is to have the world’s most advanced, innovative and successful resources sector that delivers sustained prosperity and social development for all Australians.”
