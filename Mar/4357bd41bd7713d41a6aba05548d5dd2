PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Heron Resources has warned of delays for first production at its Woodlawn base metals project, in New South Wales. The company said on Tuesday that at the start of March, it was advised by contractor Sedgman of a delay for the first ore feed into the processing plant, with ore processing now expected to start early in the second quarter of 2019, with first concentrate ready for shipment in May. The Woodlawn project was initially set to start production in the first quarter of this year. “Heron has been very committed to delivering on dates at every milestone of the Woodlawn project development. As announced on March 4, feeding ore through the plant is the only remaining step in commissioning the project and once completed, Heron will transition to becoming Australia’s newest producer of base metal concentrates,” said Heron MD Wayne Taylor. “We are naturally disappointed by this delay to our development timeline and remain committed to reaching our production milestone with our on-site team continuing to prepare for this.” At steady state, Woodlawn is expected to produce 70 000 t/y of zinc concentrates, 30 000 t/y of copper concentrates and 25 000 t/y of lead concentrates.
