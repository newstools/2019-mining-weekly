PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Lithium miner Altura Mining has increased its share purchase plan from A$5-million to A$14-million, as demand for the offer continued. The ASX-listed company on Friday said that the strong shareholder demand came on the back of an improved operational performance at the Altura lithium mine, in Western Australia, which culminated in the formal declaration of commercial production earlier this week. “We continue to be buoyed by the high level of demand from our existing shareholders. The company has turned a corner in the past few months, and it is satisfying to give as many shareholders as possible the opportunity to participate,” said MD James Brown. An additional 30.6-million shares and 15.3-million options will now be issued under the share purchase plan, bringing the total number of shares on offer to 107.69-million and the total number of options on offer to 53.8-million.
