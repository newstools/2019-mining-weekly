ASX-, Aim- and JSE-listed Kore Potash on Tuesday said it had received an engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) proposal for the Sintoukola project, in Congo-Brazzaville, from a consortium after the February 28 deadline for proposals. The late proposal was submitted by a French consortium of companies, comprising Technip France, Vinci Construction Grand Projects, Egis International and Louis Dreyfus Armateurs. Kore, nevertheless, said that it would consider all options for the development of Kola.
