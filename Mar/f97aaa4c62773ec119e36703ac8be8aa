Dual-listed Galantas Gold is stepping up its gold milling operations at the Omagh mine, in Northern Ireland, and is aiming to lift production to 50 000 oz/y in future. The company reported on Tuesday that it was running an extended day shift this quarter and that it would add another milling shift in the second quarter, followed by additional shifts in the third quarter to expand its production. It is targeting production of 2 000 oz a month to 2 500 oz a month in concentrate by 2020/21, with further expansions to 50 000 oz/y possible, the mining firm reported. The Omagh plant is currently running on a batch basis from a stockpile of underground vein material plus additional feed produced from on-vein development operations. Galantas reported that on-vein development on the 1084 (second) level continued with 32 m of vein drive completed. The main decline development tunnel had reached the 1072 (third) level and a 58 m cross-cut to intersect the Kearney vein was in progress. The main decline tunnel was now 423 m in length and the total of all underground drivages exceeded 1 136 m. For most of the rest of the year, the increased quantities of processing feed would be sourced from multiple on-vein development headings. Mining between levels (stoping) was expected by or before early 2020. The company also said that it expected Omagh to be in a cash positive position by the end of 2019.
