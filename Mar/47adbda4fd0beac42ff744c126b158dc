PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Jupiter Mines on Monday said that it reviewing its ‘strategic options’ for its Central Yilgarn iron-ore assets, given the current iron-ore market and the drive towards higher-grade ore feeds. Jupiter has appointed Hartleys as corporate advisor for the process to realise value for the projects, which include the Mount Mason direct shipping ore (DSO) hematite project, and the Mount Ida magnetite project. Jupiter told shareholders that the advanced nature of the projects, their proximity to established and available infrastructure, the size and the quality of the mineral resources, as well as the ease of mining and ore extraction, would provide attractive opportunities to start high-grade DSO hematite production and magnetite concentrate production, which could underpin long-term supply. Both projects are on granted mining leases and include a constructed accommodation camp, with the projects covering some 490 km2 of tenement area.
