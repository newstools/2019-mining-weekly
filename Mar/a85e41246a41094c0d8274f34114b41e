Sibanye-Stillwater on Monday said the South African Labour Court has dismissed the application made by the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU) to interdict the Section 189A restructuring process at the miner’s gold operations in South Africa. Sibanye on February 14 announced that it would start a process of restructuring its nonprofitable gold operations, this while AMCU has been on strike at the miner’s gold operations since mid-November, owing to a wage dispute. AMCU made an application on March 6 to interdict the restructuring process. “Contemplating potential restructuring of this nature is never taken lightly and we are aware of the possible impact on our employees. As we said when we announced the S189, we have consistently highlighted the operational and financial risks associated with the underperformance of the affected shafts at future forum meetings, which have been held regularly with stakeholders (including the unions) in an attempt to collectively find ways to address ongoing losses. “Attempts to jointly devise viable alternative measures, have however been unsuccessful so far. We urge AMCU and other stakeholders to participate in this process, so that we can jointly find ways to mitigate possible job losses at the operations,” said Sibanye CEO Neal Froneman.
