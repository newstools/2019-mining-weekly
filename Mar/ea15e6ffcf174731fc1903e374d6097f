During the year, the company completed its Bagassi South expansion project, at the Yaramoko mine, and announced its intention to acquire the Séguéla gold project in Côte d'Ivoire from Newcrest Mining. “In looking ahead to 2019, we expect to have a strong year in which we are forecasting production to be between 145 000 oz and 155 000 oz of gold. We also look forward to adding to our growth pipeline from our on-going exploration activities at Yaramoko and through our Séguéla gold project acquisition,” said CEO and president John Dorward.
