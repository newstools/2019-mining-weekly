The Ontario government has used the yearly Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada (PDAC) convention to announce to the global mining industry that the province is open for business and that it will remove barriers to investment. Premier Doug Ford and Energy, Northern Development and Mines Minister Greg Rickford announced this week that Ontario would establish a special mining working group focusing on reducing red tape and attracting major new investments. "For too long, Ontario's minerals sector has been mired in lengthy regulatory approvals and other barriers to investment," said Rickford. "By convening this working group of industry leaders, our government is sending a strong signal to the world that Ontario's mining industry is open for business and open for jobs." Ontario’s mining industry creates more than 26 000 direct and 50 000 indirect jobs. The group is chaired by Rickford and brings together industry representatives from mining and exploration companies, prospectors and Indigenous business organisations.
