Aim-listed Oriole Resources has reported a peak assay of 531 parts per billion (ppb) gold, or 0.53 g/t of gold, from 2 119 soil sampling results received for its Wapouzé project, in Cameroon. The company collected material from about 30 cm to 40 cm below surface, within the upper saprolite zone, as well as 146 rock-chip and lag samples from selective quartz veins and float material. Of the 2 119 soil samples, six samples assayed greater than 100 ppb gold, while 34 samples returned more than 20 ppb gold and 106 samples defined broader zones of lower-grade (less than 10 ppb gold) anomalism. These results have outlined two main zones of north-east trending gold in soil anomalism – the Bataol zone, with multiple parallel anomalies that grade more than 10 ppb and the Bidzar zone, which has multiple long anomalies in the south-east, including one grading more than 60 ppb gold. The company said selective rock-chip and lag samples have returned a best grade of 7.36 g/t gold, in the Bidzar zone. Oriole will soon start an infill soil sampling programme at the Bataol zone. “This initial wide-spaced soil sampling programme at Wapouzé was designed to test the eastern limb of the licence, where reconnaissance sampling by Reservoir Minerals had previously returned occasional gold assays from stream sediments. “This first phase soils programme has been successful in defining continuous gold anomalism in wide corridors over a cumulative strike length of about 13 km in the northern portion – Bataol – and in identifying new anomalies in the south – Bidzar. “Each of these independent corridor zones of gold in-soils anomalism has the scale and potential to host significant mineralisation,” said CEO Tim Lovesey. He added that the sampling further supports the company’s position that the licences at Bibemi and Wapouzé have the capacity to host a brand-new gold district.
