Newmont Mining Corp said on Wednesday that initial talks on a possible Nevada joint venture with Barrick Gold Corp were productive. Barrick CE Mark Bristow and Newmont CEO Gary Goldberg met for dinner on Tuesday night in New York. Major shareholders have pushed for a Nevada JV, expressing concern a full combination of both companies, which Barrick wants, could be too complex. "The meeting between the two principals was productive and a good starting point," Newmont spokesperson Omar Jabara said. Barrick was not immediately available to comment.
