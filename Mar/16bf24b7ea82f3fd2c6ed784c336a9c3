Digital technology and its role in the mining industry’s future will once again be prominent at the Wits Sibanye-Stillwater Digital Mining Laboratory (DigiMine) seminar, which will be held on April 8 and 9. The event will be held at the Wits Mining Institute, on the University of the Witwatersrand’s campus, and will especially highlight advances in terms of Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) technologies applicable to the mining industry. Wits Mining Institute director Professor Fred Cawood said the event was more than a seminar – it is experiencing twenty-first century mining and will be valuable to anyone interested in how digital mining is applied in the underground environment.
