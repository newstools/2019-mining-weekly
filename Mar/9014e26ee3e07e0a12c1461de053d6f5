Diamond miner De Beers on Tuesday reported that the value of its rough diamond sales for cycle two of the year was $490-million, compared with $500-million in cycle one and $563-million in cycle two of 2018. This brings the provisional total for rough diamond sales to date this year to $990-million. De Beers sold about $5.39-billion of rough diamonds in 2018, and about $5.31-billion of rough diamonds in 2017. CEO Bruce Cleaver said demand for rough diamonds remained consistent during the cycle. “While overall demand for lower-value rough diamonds remains subdued, we did see an increase in demand from India as factories begin to restock.”
