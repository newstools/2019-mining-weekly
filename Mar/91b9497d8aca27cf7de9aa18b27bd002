TSX- and NYSE-listed Kinross Gold has promoted Andrea Freeborough to CFO with effect from May 1, replacing Tony Giardini, who will be leaving the company after six years in a senior role at the mining company. “Tony’s commitment to financial discipline and maintaining a strong balance sheet, and his sharp focus on capital management, have strengthened the company’s financial position and equipped us to execute on our development projects and invest in our future,” president and CEO Paul Rollinson commented on Monday. He stated that Freeborough’s track record at Kinross, and throughout her career, including accounting, international finance, merger and acquisition (M&A), and deep management experience, would be an excellent addition to its leadership team. “We have great talent at Kinross and succession planning is a key aspect of retaining that talent for the future success of our company.” Freeborough first joined Kinross in 2009 as VP corporate controller. In 2013, she took on additional responsibility as VP finance, building and strengthening the finance team, centralising certain finance functions, and leading the finance aspects of due diligence and integration of all M&A projects and company financings. In 2017, she took on the role of VP investor relations and corporate development, providing leadership for the acquisition of two hydroelectric power plants in Brazil that are expected to substantially reduce costs at Paracatu, and helped drive investor engagement. Previously, she was at KPMG working at the firm’s Toronto, London and New Jersey/New York offices. Freeborough was named one of the “100 Global Inspirational Women in Mining” by Women in Mining (UK) in 2016.
