Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Tuesday dropped by the yearly Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada (PDAC) conference, in Toronto, telling delegates that the minerals industry is important to the prosperity of the country. According to a statement issued by the PDAC, he discussed the industry’s contribution to innovation and its partnerships with Indigenous people. “What we’re trying to do as a country, and what you are certainly doing as an industry, is look to where things are going,” said the Prime Minister. “The investments in innovation, in research, in science, in partnerships with Indigenous people are all things that are going to stabilise and give you opportunities to be more competitive in coming years.” Trudeau addressed delegates in a special conversation with PDAC president Glenn Mullan, where he highlighted the government’s support for Canada’s mineral industry, particularly the recent five-year extension of the Mineral Exploration Tax Credit – the first multi-year extension since its inception in 2000. “We very much appreciate that the Prime Minister joined us at our iconic PDAC convention to discuss the challenges and opportunities faced by Canada’s minerals sector, and the best ways to move forward in collaboration,” added Mullan.
