JOHANNESBURG – The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) on Thursday urged the government to hold the mining industry accountable for its failures, after a worker died at Modikwa Platinum Mine in Limpopo due to a fall of ground. "One death is too many and we call on the department of mineral resources to start implementing the Mine Health and Safety Act to its fullest," NUM  north east regional secretary Phillip Mankge said in a statement. "We appeal to the lawmakers to propose a long sentencing and heavy penalty to any mine that kills a person," he added. Mankge said drastic action was needed to compel the mining industry to comply with safety standards and procedures. The state must also undertake a technical audit into the mining industry, looking at ageing and ailing infrastructure that he said continued to fail hundreds of miners and left thousands of people orphaned.
