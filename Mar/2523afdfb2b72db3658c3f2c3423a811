SkyTEM has completed Phase 2 of the airborne electromagnetic (AEM) survey over the northern section of LSE-listed Kavango Resources’ prospecting licences that cover much of the Kalahari Suture Zone (KSZ) structure, in southwest Botswana. The AEM survey covered about 2 100 line kilometres to the north of Hukuntsi in southwest Botswana, over prospecting licences PL163/2012, PL365/2018, part of PL364/2018 and single lines in PL509/2014 and PL510/2014. Preliminary results indicate that SkyTEM’s new-generation 312 high power (HP) technology has achieved exceptional depth of investigation beneath the Kalahari sand cover and Karoo sediments owing to the high moment (HM) mode with a high current and a low base frequency of 12.5 Hz. The 312 HP system has been on the market since 2017 and represents a major advance in AEM systems, Kavango said in a statement published on Monday. The AEM data is currently being interpreted and modelled by Kavango’s duly appointed external consultants, Aarhus Geophysics in Denmark, in conjunction with SkyTEM. Results of the interpretation, with priority targets for ground follow-up and drilling, will be announced when they become available. “We are pleased to announce the successful conclusion of SkyTEM’s AEM survey covering the northern part of KSZ project area,” commented Kavango CEO Michael Foster. “The KSZ project covers over 9 000 km2 of prospective ground for the discovery of base metal deposits in southwest Botswana. The company has now covered about 50% of the KSZ licence area with airborne geophysics. “The key now is for a thorough ground follow-up plus, of course, drilling of further priority targets over the coming months.”
