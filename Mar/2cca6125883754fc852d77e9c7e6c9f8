Engineering management group DRA Global’s basic engineering services contract on the Kakula mine portion of the greater Kamoa-Kakula copper project, in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), is progressing well and is anticipated to be complete by mid-2019. The mine is being developed by Kamoa Copper – a joint venture between Ivanhoe Mines, Zijin Mining Group and the DRC government. The mine, once commissioned, is anticipated to yield six-million tonnes a year in its first phase. The Kakula resource is estimated at 174-million tonnes of copper at a grade of 5.62%. DRA has worked with Ivanhoe before, on its Platreef platinum group metals, nickel and copper project, in South Africa. DRA was awarded a contract to complete the prefeasibility study for Kamoa Copper in 2017. In October 2018, DRA was further awarded the contract to deliver a complete basic engineering package. The contract scope included the basic engineering and design associated with all underground mining infrastructure, the concentrator plant and all supporting surface infrastructure.
