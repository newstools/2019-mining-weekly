PERTH (miningweekly.com) â€“ The share price of ASX-listed Capricorn Metals rose by more than 10% on Wednesday following a board spill. A Capricorn shareholder meeting was called by Nero Resources and Neon Capital in February this year, with the two companies holding a combined 5.5% interest in Capricorn. MD Warren Hallam and CFO and joint company secretary Jonathon Shellabear have resigned their positions, while nonexecutive directors Debra Bakker, Geoffrey Rogers and Peter Benjamin were removed from the board following a general meeting on Tuesday. Hallam was appointed as CEO and MD in February this year, following an external search. He was previously MD and CEO of fellow-listed Metals X and Metals Exploration. Neon and Nero nominees Timothy Kestell and Douglas Jendry have been appointed as nonexecutive directors.
