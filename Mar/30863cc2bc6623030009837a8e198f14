Mine restoration at the Mir diamond mine, which flooded about a year-and-a-half ago, is only expected to start after 2024, Russian miner Alrosa reported on Monday, detailing the timelines for the potential restart of the Siberian underground operation. To decide on the mine’s fate, Alrosa would start on exploration down to 1 300 m to confirm the operation’s reserves. Budgeted to cost two-billion ruble, these activities were scheduled to be completed by early 2022. Based on the results of the exploration work, pilot holes would be drilled to start preparation of deposit opening design documents and this should be completed by 2024. Simultaneously, Alrosa said it would carry out conceptual design activities to ensure water disposal at the mine and choose the best mining technology, as well as ventilation and gas safety options. If it was decided that the restoration of the Mir underground mine was feasible, the construction would take six to eight years, the company said. “The Mir mine restoration can start no earlier than 2024 and only if the studies yield positive results, and if it is confirmed that construction and mining can be done with the highest level of occupational safety,” the company noted. Production at the Mir underground mine was halted in August 2017 after it was partially flooded.
