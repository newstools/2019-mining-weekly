Jupiter Mines has appointed Melissa North to the board of directors as FD, effective March 18. North, who is the first female to be appointed to the Jupiter board, joined Jupiter in 2012 as group financial controller and was subsequently appointed CFO and company secretary. Over the past seven years, she has played an integral part in the development of Jupiter, culminating in its ASX listing in April 2018 and its subsequent evolution into a successful ASX300 company. North will retain her role as CFO and company secretary. Moreover, she will now be tasked with the day-to-day investor relations for the company. Jupiter commented in a release published on Tuesday that the appointment of a woman to its board was an “important step to greater board diversity”. “We are delighted to welcome Melissa to the board. We are fortunate to have her in-depth knowledge of the business represented on the board,” Jupiter chairperson Brian Gilbertson commented.
