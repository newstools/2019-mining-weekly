TSX- and JSE-listed Atlatsa Resources Corporation has obtained consent from the TSX and the British Columbia Registry Services for a further extension of the outside date for its annual general meeting (AGM) to May 22. Atlatsa was, in September 2018, granted an initial extension to the outside date for its AGM. At the meeting, the company will present the second phase of its 2017 restructure plan for shareholder approval. Atlatsaâ€™s restructure plan is targeted at the Bokoni platinum mine, in Limpopo, which was placed on care and maintenance in October 2017. Atlatsa in July 2017 announced a two-phased restructure plan for the mine, which comprised a care and maintenance strategy for the mine and a financial restructure plan for the company and its subsidiaries.
