PERTH (miningweekly.com) – US oil and gas giant Chevron has given the go-ahead for the front-end engineering and design (FEED) work for the Jansz-Io compression project at the Gorgon natural gas facility, offshore Western Australia. In an Australian first, the project will use subsea compression to enhance recovery of the Jansz-Io field to maintain long-term natural gas supply to the 15.6-million-tonne-a-year liquefied natural gas and domestic gas plants on Barrow Island. Chevron Australia GM for major capital projects Jeff Schmoll said at this week’s AOG conference, in Perth, that the Jansz-Io compression project will prolong the life of Gorgon’s Jansz Io-fields and was part of the original development plan for the project. Schmoll said that the proposed project would include significant local opportunities in the FEED work. “These opportunities include all onshore components as well as potential scopes across local engineering, project management, fabrication, onshore construction, subsea installation and support. “The Jansz-IoI compression local content work comes on top of more than A40-billion spent on Australian goods and services on Gorgon spread across more than 700 contracts to Australian companies,” Schmoll said.
