The South African National Energy Association (Sanea) announced on Tuesday that it had appointed Kiren Maharaj as its new chairperson. Sanea is the South African member committee of the World Energy Council. Maharaj, who has been a Sanea director since 2017, previously worked as a divisional executive at Eskom Holdings. In February, she was appointed MD of local professional services company Gibb Power, in which international power group EDF has a 30% interest. Sanea also announced that Wendy Poulton, who is also a Sanea director and Eskom’s organisational strategy GM, had been appointed secretary-general. Maharaj succeeds Sanea stalwart Brian Statham, who served as the organisation’s founding secretary-general from 2000 to 2006 and as its executive chairperson from March 2007 to March 2019. Statham also served two terms as an officer of the World Energy Council, where he was elected as an honorary officer at its executive assembly in 2016. He has served on a number of governmental task forces and committees dealing with energy matters, including a two-year term as a member of the Ministerial Advisory Council on Energy.
