PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The Queensland government has given ASX-listed Senex Energy environmental approval for its Project Atlas natural gas project, in the Surat basin. Senex in January received confirmation from the federal Department of the Environment and Energy that all requirements under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act had been satisfied. The company on Wednesday said that with the federal and state environmental approvals now in place, Senex was able to move to the full development of the project. “When Senex was awarded the Project Atlas block by the Queensland government we committed to deliver first gas to domestic customers within two years. We will achieve this and more with development drilling to commence shortly and commissioning of our gas facilities by the end of 2019, followed by first gas sales to domestic customers,” said Senex MD and CEO Ian Davies. Project Atlas is expected to reach a plateau production of 32 TJ/d, or about two-million barrels a year of oil equivalent, with an additional 8 TJ/d of installed redundant capacity available. The Senex board last year approved a capital spend of between A$220-million and A$250-million to develop the Project Atlas and the Roma North natural gas projects.
