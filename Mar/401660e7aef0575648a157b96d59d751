The company has a strong and supportive shareholder base, which has now had the opportunity to revitalize for the next stage of the company’s growth,” said MD Ron Heeks. “At this inflection point for the company, as we advance financing due diligence for Woodlark, we also welcome new and supportive substantial shareholders onto the register.” A 2018 definitive feasibility study into the Woodlark project estimated that the project would require a capital investment of A$198.5-million, with the mine expected to produce 967 117 oz of gold over a 13-year mine life.
