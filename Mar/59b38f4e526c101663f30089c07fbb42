ASX-listed Heron Resources on Monday announced that wet commissioning had started at the process plant of its Woodlawn base metals project, in New South Wales. The only remaining step in commissioning the project was to feed ore through the plant. Once completed, the company would transition to a producer of base metal concentrates. MD Wayne Taylor said it has been 18 months since construction activities kicked off and that the project build process was fast approaching its end. “Both the hydraulic mining and underground activities are well placed to start feeding ore into the plant and this is expected to start in the next few weeks.” At steady state, Woodlawn is expected to produce 70 000 t/y of zinc concentrates, 30 000 t/y of copper concentrates and 25 000 t/y of lead concentrates.
