PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Coal production at the Poplar Grove mine, in Kentucky, is ramping up on the back of higher productivity, and continuous underground mining operations, owner Paringa Resources said on Tuesday. First delivery of processed coal to customer LG&E is targeted for the second half of March. The ASX-listed company told shareholders that initial coal mining has been undertaken by the mining contractor, as part of the mine development. However, Paringa-operated mining equipment and staff would now be responsible for producing coal. The 2.8-million-tonne-a-year Poplar Grove thermal coal mine forms part of Paringa’s 40 000-acre Buck Creek complex, which also contains the 3.8-million-tonne-a-year Cypress mine, where construction is set to begin in 2019.
