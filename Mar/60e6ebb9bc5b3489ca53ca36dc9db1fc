MELBOURNE - Rio Tinto said on Wednesday it has suspended its Weipa bauxite mining operations at the northeastern tip of the country ahead of a cyclone. "Operations have been suspended at Weipa as Cyclone Trevor approaches the coast, as per standard procedures," a spokesman told Reuters by email. Bauxite is the raw material used to make aluminium.
