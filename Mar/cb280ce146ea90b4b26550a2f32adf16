Mineral Resources Minister Gwede Mantashe has requested the assistance of Police Minister Bheki Cele to intervene in the current instability in Carletonville and to safeguard the community. A statement issued by the Department of Mineral Resources (DMR) on Tuesday claimed that the ongoing strike by members of the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union at Sibanye-Stillwater’s gold operations in the region, has become violent and is negatively impacting on communities in the area. The DMR stated that nine deaths have been reported so far, while an estimated 62 houses have been burnt down. Cele is expected to visit the area in the next few days. AMCU’s strike has been ongoing at Sibanye’s gold operations since November 2018. This follows after AMCU refused to sign a wage agreement with the precious metals miner. Mantashe on Tuesday visited the West Rand mining area as part of his ongoing engagements with stakeholders in the mining industry to ensure the industry contributes positively to the economy. Mantashe reportedly visited burnt-down houses of nonstriking mineworkers in Driefontein, in the Carletonville area. The DMR stated in an earlier release on Tuesday that the safety of mineworkers, at and outside of work, as well as that of communities, was of paramount importance to the Minister and the department.
