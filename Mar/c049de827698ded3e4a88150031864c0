PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Lithium miner Galaxy Resources has finalised the pre-development agreement (PDA) and the environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA) for its James Bay project, in Quebec. The ASX-listed Galaxy has entered into the PDA with the Grand Council of the Cree, the Cree Nation government and the Cree Nation of Eastmain regarding the development of the mine, which is some 10 km from the Eastmain river and 100 km from the Eastmain community. Under the PDA, Galaxy would undertake to notify the Cree parties of employment and training opportunities to maximise employment and training for the local Cree community, with Galaxy remaining committed to preferential hiring of qualified Crees; to seek business proposals from Cree enterprises; and to hire a local community liaison coordinator. Meanwhile, Galaxy told shareholders that the submission of its ESIA to the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency was a critical milestone for the project. “The submission of the ESIA represents a critical step in the development of the James Bay lithium mine project. We look forward to working in collaboration with the Cree, the Environmental and Social Impact Review Committee, both provincial and federal authorities through the assessment and review process, said Galaxy GM for Canada, Denis Couture. The James Bay project contains an indicated resource of 40.3-million tonnes, grading 1.4% lithium oxide.
