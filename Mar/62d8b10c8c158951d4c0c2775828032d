Gold miner Acacia Mining on Friday assured its shareholders that it was working on a solution to prevent any seepage from its tailing storage facility (TSF) at the North Mara mine, in Tanzania. The government of Tanzania had also directed the mine to resolve a spillage of water at its polishing pond, which the company said had since been resolved. The spillage resulted from a security incident in which sections of the pipe used to transport water from the polishing pond to the TSF had either been vandalised or stolen. This led to the switching off of the pump used to transport water to the TSF, and the water level in the polishing pond overflowing. Acacia said it welcomed the support of the Tanzanian government in resolving this issue and said it was working closely with the authorities to implement improvements to security measures around the polishing pond to help prevent any reoccurrence. The miner further highlighted that the mineâ€™s technical team was working with government to address its concerns in an agreed timeframe. The mine has, subsequently, undertaken to manage all seepage through the use of additional pumps and the construction of other containment facilities to return any seepage to the TSF and ensure it is confined to the mine site. All seepage will be contained on the site, will not flow into the surrounding environment or present a risk of contamination to any public water source, Acacia said. In January, the Tanzanian government issued a directive to the mine to build a new TSF. Since receiving the directive, the mine has started planning and designing a new TSF and is working with the government to progress the construction of the new TSF to support its future mine production plans. Operations at the mine remain unaffected.
