Despite economic challenges and uncertainty, the mining industry is experiencing a “renaissance and a renewed sense of confidence”, Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada (PDAC) president Glenn Mullan remarked on Wednesday, as the yearly mining convention wrapped up in Toronto. “After my forty-fourth year attending the PDAC convention, the enthusiasm I saw from exhibitors and attendees in 2019 was among the best yet,” he said, noting that the convention had highlighted the resilience of the industry once more. The 2019 convention was attended by 25 843 people from more than 130 countries. Reflecting on one of highlights of the 2019 event, Mullan said that the discussion with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau centred on government’s support for the mineral sector through the recent renewal of the Mineral Exploration Tax Credit for five years, along with the mining industry’s leadership in Indigenous partnerships, responsible exploration and how the sector could remain competitive in the global stage. Mullan is the outgoing president of PDAC and will be succeeded by Felix Lee. Next year’s PDAC convention will be held from March 1 to 4.
