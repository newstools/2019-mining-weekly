The Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU) has accepted, in principle, a proposed settlement agreement advanced by the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA), in at attempt to resolve the wage dispute between the union and precious metals miner Sibanye-Stillwater. The union has had a protracted strike at the minerâ€™s gold operations since November 21, to date. The CCMA facilitated engagement between AMCU and Sibanye in terms of legislation that is designed to break deadlocks during collective bargaining processes, when there is sufficient public interest in a particular matter. The CCMA proposed a payment of R5 700, coupled with other benefits as contained in a previous settlement agreement. These include a salary advance of R5 000, debt consolidation, nondeductions of employer contributions to benefits, death benefits of employees who passed on during the strike, as well as disciplinary issues. While AMCU members previously indicated acceptance of the other issues covered, up to now they insisted on a payment of R9 300. AMCU leaders conducted mass meetings last Friday, during which the union accepted the proposed settlement by the CCMA in broad terms, before mandating the negotiating team to engage further with Sibanye on the implementation and method of payment, as well as the issue of back-pay. At the meeting facilitated by the CCMA on Tuesday, AMCU communicated its in-principle acceptance of the proposed settlement, emphasising that the R5 700 should be split over two years of the wage agreement term, which is three years in total, as well as back-pay for the first year of the term. Even though Sibanye has not accepted the proposal by the CCMA, AMCU remains positive that this will create the necessary momentum to see a speedy resolution to the wage dispute.
