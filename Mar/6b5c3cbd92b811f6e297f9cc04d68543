ASX-listed Orion Minerals on Tuesday announced that it had signed a renewable energy generation collaboration agreement with Juwi Renewable Energies South Africa to investigate the renewable energy generation potential at the Prieska zinc/copper project, in South Africa’s Northern Cape province. The preliminary scope of the collaboration is to assess the feasibility of a dedicated 35 MW solar and wind hybrid power plant for the project. The results of this work will inform the long-term power supply strategy for Prieska, in line with local government integrated development plans. Orion CEO and MD Errol Smart said the Northern Cape region has the highest irradiance levels in the country, with a hot and dry climate (suitable for solar farms) and is also well-situated for wind farms with its wide open spaces. “It is already a well-established renewable energy generating region, with 190 MW of solar power plants in operation and 240 MW of wind power currently under construction, which are adjacent to the Prieska project. “The renewable energy opportunity can only improve our long-term power supply security, while simultaneously lessening the burden on the national electricity grid and reducing carbon and water footprints,” Smart said. He added that the investigation into possible renewable energy solutions at Prieska will complement the ongoing bankable feasibility study.
