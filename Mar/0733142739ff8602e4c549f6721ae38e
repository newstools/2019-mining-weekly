PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Gold miner Millennium Minerals on Wednesday reported that development of its Golden Gate mine would start in the second quarter of the 2019 financial year. The company told shareholders that with a processing route now identified, and commissioning of the Stage 1 sulphide plant upgrade scheduled for April this year at the Nullagine plant, the Golden Gate region has become a major focus for Millennium’s exploration efforts. “The ongoing exploration and development of the Golden Gate mining center forms a central part of our quality driven mining strategy, focused on higher-grade ore sources that will increase head grade and reduce operating costs,” said Millennium CEO Peter Cash. “We have specifically targeted this region due to its known high-grade sulphide mineralisation, with ore from Golden Gate expected to contribute to an increased head grade, as well as providing a major source of feed for the sulphide expansion project.” First ore from the Golden Gate underground mine is scheduled to coincide with the commissioning of the Stage 2 sulphide plant expansion, scheduled for early 2020, which will facilitate the treatment of arsenopyrite-dominant ore. Meanwhile, Millennium is undertaking drilling to extend and upgrade the existing resources and reserves at Golden Gate, ahead of the planned start of mine development in the September quarter.
