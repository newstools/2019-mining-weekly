As the merger of Newmont and Goldcorp now looks set for closure in the second quarter, the US gold mining company on Tuesday unveiled its new leadership team. Gary Goldberg will remain as CEO until the fourth quarter, when he will retire, to be succeeded by Tom Palmer as president and CEO. Rob Atkinson will take over the COO position from Palmer on June 1. Other promotions include Jennifer Cmil as executive VP for human resources, Dean Gehring as VP and chief technology officer, Steve Gottesfeld as executive VP and chief sustainability and external affairs officer and Nancy Lipson executive VP and general counsel. Randy Engel will remain as VP for strategic development and Marcelo Godoy as senior VP for exploration. “Going forward, Newmont Goldcorp will maintain its focus on the success and continuity of our business through strategic leadership development, building high performing teams, and robust succession planning,” said Palmer. “This focus ensures that Newmont Goldcorp will maintain deep bench strength and top talent to effectively run our business, achieve competitive advantage and continue to deliver superior business results and long-term value for our shareholders and other stakeholders,” he noted. Newmont and Goldcorp announced their $10-billion combination in January, but the deal was on shaky ground recently, after Newmont shareholders revolted over an “unfair” benefit that Goldcorp shareholders would have following the Nevada joint venture agreement between Newmont and Barrick. Newmont placated its shareholders, who will vote on the Goldcorp merger on April 11, with a promise of an 88c-a-share special dividend if the transaction succeeds.
