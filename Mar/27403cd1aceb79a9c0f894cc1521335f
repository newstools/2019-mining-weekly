Cora Gold has received positive results from the preliminary metallurgical test work programme for oxide samples taken from the Zone A and Selin prospects at the Sanankoro gold discovery in the Yanfolila gold belt in Southern Mali. Preliminary results demonstrate that coarse ore gold recoveries of up to 97%, depending on crush size, are achievable through cyanide leach extraction. According to the company, the programme indicated “excellent” gold recovery characteristics with similar testwork response observed across both oxide ore samples. The results are indicative of potential for industry standard process methodology for the extraction of gold. The objective of the programme was to establish a preliminary indication of the response of the oxide mineralisation to gold extraction by cyanide leach to test both heap leach and carbon-in-leach (CIL) methodologies and provide guidance on potential future development scenarios. The results will inform the next stage of the metallurgical testwork programme, which will be focused on providing further information on both the heap leach potential and gravity-CIL process routes. “These results indicate the clear potential to be able to use heap leach or CIL as a process methodology in the future and, as such, are highly encouraging,” commented Cora CEO Dr Jonathan Forster. He indicated that, upon completion of the full programme, the company will have a good indication of the appropriate process methodology and can then begin planning for a more detailed metallurgical programme that will support and progress the Sanankoro project towards potential development scenarios.
