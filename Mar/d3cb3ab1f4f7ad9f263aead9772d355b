Black-owned mining services company Mmutle Mining Projects has secured six contracts with different mining companies since Mining Charter 3 was gazetted in September last year. In December, Mineral Resources Minister Gwede Mantashe published the implementation guidelines of the charter, which demands the mining industry implement ownership, mineral beneficiation, procurement and supplier development requirements as part of their licence to operate. The third iteration of the charter places specific emphasis on procurement from black-owned suppliers and service providers, with Mmutle Mining reaping the benefits thereof. Industrial engineer John Mmutle says Zizwe Opencast Mining, which bought out Fraser Alexander Bulk Mech, which previously employed Mmutle as a contract manager, provided him with the necessary skills development and support to establish an independent mining services company. Additionally, the National Empowerment Fund provided Mmutle R13-million for plant, equipment and working capital. “The changes to the Mining Charter requirements around procurement targets for mining companies gives small businesses like mine a chance to participate in the economy,” said Mmutle, adding that small companies are now able to bid on bigger platforms with big companies that will partner with and incubate small businesses. Mmutle Mining now employs 73 people. Some of its recently awarded contracts include work for Impala Platinum, in Rustenburg.
