The K&S mine, which has been experiencing trouble with the drying unit, has managed to ramp up capacity to 86% in the second half of February, Hong Kong-listed IRC reported on Friday. The operating issues with the drying unit had prevented K&S from operating at a higher capacity, but the company had now implemented various mitigating measures, which improved performance. “We can now concentrate our efforts on resolving the remaining bottlenecks,” said CEO Yury Makarov, adding that the plant should be at full capacity soon. In January, IRC reported that K&S was operating at a reduced capacity of 62%. At the time, the company explained that the drying unit required more time than planned to achieve a 3% moisture level required by certain of its customers. IRC plans to make a claim against the supplier of the drying unit, it said earlier this year. London-listed Petropavlovsk has a 31% shareholding in IRC.
