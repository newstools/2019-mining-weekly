The Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU) on Tuesday said it denied that the strike action at precious metals miner Sibanye-Stillwater's gold operations has become a personal vendetta between AMCU president Joseph Mathunjwa and Sibanye CEO Neal Froneman. In its statement, issued following a media briefing, the union said its members have shown "great courage" to sacrifice their comfort and income "for the greater struggle for economic emancipation". AMCU's members have been on strike at Sibanye's South African gold operations since November 2018, in dispute over a wage agreement. The union has since called for employees at Sibanye's platinum operations, as well as employees at other mining companies' platinum operations, to embark on a sympathy strike with those who are already on strike. Sibanye, meanwhile, has said it is considering restructuring its gold operations. Meanwhile, AMCU on Tuesday also spoke out against Mineral Resources Minister Gwede Mantashe for involving the Police Minister in the labour dispute. Mantashe last week called on Police Minister Bheki Cele to help protect the Carletonville community, as the strike at Sibanye's operations have "become violent". The Department of Mineral Resources reported at the time that nine people had been killed so far, while about 62 houses have been burnt down. AMCU said it was irresponsible of Mantashe to call for the South African Police Service to intervene in a labour matter.
